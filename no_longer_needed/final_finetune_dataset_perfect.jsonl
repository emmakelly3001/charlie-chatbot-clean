They offer funding to eligible students in approved courses at PLC, undergraduate, and postgraduate levels.</p><p>This funding is awarded in line with the Student Support Act 2011, the Student Grant Scheme, and Student Support Regulations. All decisions about applications are made entirely by SUSI; NCI does not have any input into the grant decision process.</p><p>Am I eligible for a SUSI grant?</p><p>SUSI grants are open to EU, EEA, UK, and Swiss nationals, to students with specific immigration status, or those who have leave to remain permission from the Department of Justice. You must have been resident in the Irish State, the EU, EEA, UK or Swiss Federation for three of the last five years. You must also be studying on one of the approved courses and must be progressing in your education: SUSI will only award funding for contribution or contribution and maintenance for one course per NFQ level.</p><p>For more details, please see SUSI’s website, susi.ie. You can also check if you are eligible for a grant, check out the eligibility indicator on their website.</p><p>How do I apply for a SUSI grant?</p><p>Applications are made online at susi.ie</p><p>Once applications open, you are advised to apply as soon as possible as SUSI receive a high number of applications - you do not need to have your Leaving Certificate results or to have accepted a course in order to apply. You will need to update your course and college details on your SUSI account once you have accepted an offer to finalise your application.</p><p>I was awarded a grant and SUSI say that they need to confirm that I am registered at NCI, what does that mean?</p><p>Students can only receive SUSI funding once they are fully registered. In order to be registered as a student in NCI, you need to complete the registration process through your MyDetails account, which includes paying the mandatory €80 gym fee if you are a full-time undergraduate. Once this is done, the Fees team will confirm with SUSI on your behalf, that you have been registered; you do not need to send SUSI a letter confirming your registration status at NCI.</p><p>How do I send a copy of my SUSI letter to the Fees team to show that I am receiving a SUSI grant?</p><p>Please ensure that the details on your letter are correct and then send a copy of the letter to fees@ncirl.ie.</p><p>We ask that you do this as soon as possible so that your fee details can be updated.</p><p>I have changed my course and/or 3rd level institution since I applied for SUSI, is there anything I need to do?</p><p>Yes. If your application for a grant listed a course in a different 3rd level institution or a different course in NCI, you need to update your details on the SUSI website. You can do this by submitting an online Course Change Notification form in the “My Courses” section of your student portal on the SUSI website.</p><p>My application to SUSI was denied, what can I do next?</p><p>You can appeal your grant decision on the SUSI website if you are unhappy that it was denied. SUSI introduced a student contribution grant of €500 which you may be able to receive if you were not deemed eligible for the 50% or 100% grants and/or maintenance. Appeals must be made within 30 days of the original grant decision.</p><p>For more information, please see the Appeals page of the SUSI website.</p><p>I received a SUSI grant last academic year; do I need to re-apply?</p><p>Yes. All students progressing to the next level of their course need to renew their application to SUSI to be considered for funding for the next academic year. If you do not do this, it may result in you not receiving any funding for the following year.

{"instruction": "Answer the following question using clear HTML formatting, including important links where relevant.", "input": "Student Counselling and Wellness Service FAQs", "output": "<h3>Student Counselling and Wellness Service FAQs</h3><p>Who can get counselling sessions with the Counselling and Wellness Service?</p><p>All full- and part-time students who are fully registered NCI students currently studying at the college.</p><p>Please note that you must have already started the academic year to register with the Service. Also, students who have deferred and are not currently studying in the college are not eligible.</p><p>How do I register with the Counselling and Wellness Service?</p><p>After you have sent an email from your NCI student email account, a team member will send you forms you need to fill out, a registration form and a consent form, before you can be registered with the service. Once you have returned those, there will be a short waiting period, after which one of the counsellors will contact you (via email) to organise your first session.</p><p>What topics can I talk to the counsellors about?</p><p>Any issue that is causing you difficulties and which might include:</p><p>Stress</p><p>Anxiety</p><p>Academic difficulties</p><p>Relationship difficulties</p><p>Depression</p><p>Family issues</p><p>Grief or bereavement</p><p>Homesickness/loneliness</p><p>Sexual/personal identity issues</p><p>Physical assault/abuse</p><p>Self-harm</p><p>Disordered eating</p><p>Addiction or substance use</p><p>Confidence or self-esteem issues</p><p>LGBTQ+ Support</p><p>Autism/ADHD Support</p><p>Do I have to pay for the sessions?</p><p>No, the counselling sessions offered to students are free, so you do not need to pay anything.</p><p>How do I get in touch with the Counselling and Wellness Service?</p><p>Send an email to counselling@ncirl.ie from your NCI student email address. Due to Counselling and Wellness Service policies, we cannot engage with students who contact us from an external email address.</p><p>How many counselling sessions can I attend?</p><p>The service is designed to be brief, with an average of 4-6 sessions per year. Your counsellor will determine the number of sessions based on your needs. For longer-term counselling, we can refer you to external providers.</p><p>How long is each counselling session?</p><p>Sessions last 50 minutes.</p><p>How often are the meetings?</p><p>This depends on your individual needs, but they usually happen on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.</p><p>Where do the sessions take place?</p><p>We offer in-person, audio, and online sessions. In-person sessions occur in the main NCI campus building at Mayor’s Square. Online sessions are held through Microsoft Teams, and audio sessions happen via phone calls; we recommend that you find a quiet and more private space for these.</p><p>When do the sessions take place?</p><p>Sessions are offered throughout the year, including the summer months (during Semester 3). They take place between 09:30 and 16:30.</p><p>Is it confidential?</p><p>Yes. We provide a professional and confidential service, with all staff adhering to a strict code of practice and ethics. The relationship between a student and a counsellor is confidential, meaning anything you share with your counsellor stays within the Counselling Service. However, should your counsellor believe that you are at immediate risk of harming yourself or others, they may need to break confidentiality. Also, if there is a concern about a child being at risk, the Service must report this to Tusla or the Garda Síochána as per national child protection policies. In such cases, your counsellor will make every effort to discuss the situation with you and involve you in the disclosure process.</p><p>Is it inclusive?</p><p>Yes! NCI’s Student Counselling and Wellness Service recognises, acknowledges, and appreciates the dignity and diversity of all students who use our services. Our staff are dedicated to providing an inclusive service, striving to meet the unique needs of each student regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, religion, socioeconomic status, disability, ethnicity, culture, or membership of the Traveller community.</p><p>What if I have to cancel or reschedule an appointment?</p><p>If you need to cancel or reschedule, please give us as much notice as possible so we can offer the appointment to another student. Please email your counsellor or counselling@ncirl.ie to inform us of any changes.</p><p>What if I decide that counselling is not for me?</p><p>You are not required to attend further appointments if you choose not to. Students often attend only one session. If you wish to cancel your next appointment, please give us as much notice as possible so we can offer the slot to another student.</p><p>Where are my records kept, and for how long?</p><p>Counsellors must keep records of all sessions. These files are securely stored for seven years and then destroyed. If you wish to access your file, you can ask your counsellor or make a formal request to the University Freedom of Information Officer.</p><p>I am a student with mobility concerns. Can I still attend the service?</p><p>Yes, absolutely. When reserving your initial session, please email counselling@ncirl.ie in advance or mention your accessibility needs in the registration form. We will ensure your needs are met. NCI’s Student Counselling and Wellness Service premises are wheelchair accessible.</p><p>What does it mean if the Counselling and Wellness Service has a waiting list?</p><p>The Service will use a waiting list during busy periods with high demand for counselling sessions. This list is organised according to the date students contacted the service. If the waiting list is in place when you request counselling sessions, you will be informed of the approximate waiting time length: due to the nature of counselling sessions and individual needs, we cannot give exact timelines. You will also be offered a free mental health-based appointment with Hanover Medical; this is not a counselling session.</p><p></p><p>When your name reaches the top of the list, a team member will contact you and ask you to complete the forms as usual. Once these are returned, you will be given an updated approximate waiting time, after which you will be contacted about arranging your first session.</p><p>Are there any other mental health resources I can make use of?</p><p>Here are some mental health resources you can access through NCI:</p><p>Online mental health platform SilverCloud with self-guided programmes on various topics such as stress, anxiety, depression, body image, resilience, mindfulness, and sleep. It is confidential, accessible 24/7, and works well on mobile devices.</p><p>The Student Counselling and Wellness has helpful links, videos, blogs, hints, tips, and advice specifically designed for students.</p><p>You can also access our Wellness Workshops—recordings are listed on our Moodle Page.

This includes a requirement to assess the impact of policies, procedures, practices and communications in furthering the principles of equality, diversity, inclusion and fairness.</p><p>Universal Design: ensures the design and composition of an environment so that it may be accessed, understood and used to the greatest possible extent in the most independent and natural manner possible in the widest possible range of situations without the need for adaptation, modification, assistive devices or specialised solutions, by any persons of any age or size or having any particular physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual ability or disability.

This can be either conscious or unconscious.

Reporting concerns</p><p>1. Introduction</p><p>The College recognises that every employee is entitled to switch off outside of normal working hours and enjoy their free time away from work without being disturbed. There may be occasions where contact occurs, including for example where business and operational reasons require contact outside of normal working hours and depending on the nature of an employee’s role. This however should be rare and not the norm.</p><p>The health, safety, and well-being of our employees are of the utmost importance to us NCI and we encourage and support you to prioritise your wellbeing. Disconnecting from work and work devices is vital for your well-being, and to help you achieve a healthy and sustainable work-life balance.</p><p>To encourage and support our employees in balancing their working and personal lives, whether they work standard hours in the workplace, work remotely or flexibly, or work shifts we have developed a Right to Disconnect policy, which includes best practice guidance around working hours, the use of technology and more.</p><p>2. Legislative Basis</p><p>Section 20(2) of the Workplace Relations Act, 2015 provides, at the request of the Minister, the preparation of draft codes of practice by the WRC (Workplace Relations Commission) for submission to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade, and Employment.</p><p>The Code of Practice for Employers and Employees on the Right to Disconnect sets out guidelines and best practices for employers and employees.  The code of practice was agreed upon through public consultation. The thirty-seven submissions received were fully considered in the development of the Code. In finalising the Code, the WRC engaged with representatives of employers and employees including IBEC (Irish Business and Employers Confederation) and ICTU (Irish Congress for Trade Unions). This code of practice underpins NCI’s Right to Disconnect Policy.</p><p>Other legislation relevant to this policy includes:</p><p>Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997</p><p>This act does not explicitly refer to a “right to disconnect” but it does state that employers cannot permit employees to work more than a maximum of 48 hours in any one week, except in very limited circumstances. It also states that employers must keep records of hours worked and ensure that staff receive rest breaks each day as well as rest days (e.g. weekend days or other assigned days off).</p><p>The Safety and Welfare at Work Act, 2005</p><p>This act sets out the responsibilities of employers and employees about Health and Safety at work.</p><p>The Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994-2014</p><p>The purpose of the Act is to implement an EU Directive which requires employers to provide a written statement to employees setting out particulars of the employee’s terms of employment. The Act also repeals sections 9 and 10 of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973 as those sections are overtaken by the provisions of this Act.</p><p>3. Role of the College, Managers, and Employees</p><p>All employees have an active role to play in communication management and the reduction of unnecessary business communications outside normal working hours.</p><p>The College encourages the ongoing cultivation of a culture where our employees feel they can disconnect from work and work-related devices and this necessitates a joint approach by the College, our managers, and employees.</p><p>Some of the respective obligations include:</p><p>The role of the College:</p><p>To provide information to employees on their working time, by the relevant legislation (contract).</p><p>To ensure a safe workplace, in line with the health and safety legislation.</p><p>To not penalise an employee for acting in compliance with any relevant provision of the health and safety legislation.</p><p>The role of the employee:</p><p>To ensure that they manage their own working time and take care to protect their safety, health and welfare, and the health and safety of co-workers, in line with the health and safety legislation and seek support in doing so if necessary.</p><p>To cooperate fully with any appropriate mechanism utilised by the College to record working time, including when working remotely.</p><p>To respect the working time of colleagues and other contacts (including periods of leave).</p><p>The role of the manager:</p><p>Managers in particular play a central role in the successful implementation of this policy and have a duty to respect their team members’ right to disconnect and should provide a good example for their team.</p><p>4. Working Hours</p><p>The College’s ‘normal working hours’ are clearly set out in each staff members individual contract of employment. Managers must be aware of these different work patterns and hours pertaining to each staff member reporting to them.</p><p>There are legitimate reasons where a staff member may be contacted out of hours e.g. a serious data breach where technology needs to be powered down, in the event of a death, where there is something stipulated within the contract of employment whereby contact outside of hours maybe required from time to time.</p><p>Ensure to block out time in your diary to hold time for your breaks.</p><p>5. Communications</p><p>We use a range of communication methods in the course of our work. Try and ensure good practice for your own and your colleagues working time in each area.</p><p>Electronic & Phone Communications</p><p>The College respects your personal time and expects you to disconnect from work e-mails and work communications outside of normal working hours.</p><p>It is acknowledged that the working “norm” for one may be different for another and due to differing/non-standard patterns of work within the College. Some employees may send communications at times that are opportune for themselves, but inopportune for other employees, e.g. late nights/weekends. These should be sent without any intent to disturb the recipient or in expectation of a speedy answer/response during hours of non-attendance.</p><p>In that event, bear in mind the following:</p><p>Try to only check and send e-mails during normal working hours where possible, but we are also mindful of the requirements of those who wish to work in a more flexible manner.</p><p>The sender should give due consideration to the timing of their communication and potential for disturbance. The recipient should understand that they will not be expected to respond until their working time recommences. If you are sending emails outside the normal hours of the working day, please also consider other people’s working hours:</p><p>Send the e-mail with a signature disclaimer at the end, e.g. “I have sent this email at a time that is convenient for me. I do not expect you to respond to it outside of your usual working hours.”</p><p>Consider drafting the email and sending it during normal working hours or using the ‘delay send’ option and set it to a specified time on the next working day</p><p>Always consider the tone/contents/context of texts and emails and other electronic communications (e.g. instant messaging apps).</p><p>Please ensure that your out-of-office notifications are properly activated when you are out of the office and that your out-of-office message correctly directs the recipient to the appropriate colleague.</p><p>Please respect out-of-office notifications when you receive them from others.</p><p>In the case of an urgent or time-sensitive situation after normal working hours, please consider the need and urgency before sending an email. Consider a phone call as an alternative.</p><p>Where the monitoring of social media channels or platforms are an integral part of your role then staff maybe required to monitor and update information at any time, particularly in the case of emergency communications e.g. adverse weather, pandemic, IT outages.</p><p>Please note that work communications through social media channels or platforms are not encouraged and employees should not feel that they must respond to social communications from colleagues outside of their working hours.</p><p>6. Meetings</p><p>While meetings can be crucial to strengthen connections between individuals and teams, individual teams and managers are encouraged to review the frequency and timing of meetings they hold to ensure optimum use of time and allow colleagues time to work outside of meetings.</p><p>Avoid scheduling meetings outside of our core hours or during lunch hours, unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>Respect people's time by only inviting them to meetings where their presence is necessary.</p><p>Share and adopt best practice for meetings, for example ensure there is a clear agenda with relevant material shared in advance, with actions recorded and shared post meetings.</p><p>7. Wellbeing</p><p>Employees, including those engaging in flexible working arrangements or remote working, are reminded to switch off from work and work devices outside their normal working hours and while on leave.</p><p>Employees are encouraged to familiarise themselves with their break entitlements as set out in their contracts and ensure that they are availing of these. If an employee is unable to avail of their rest break, they should inform their manager.</p><p>Employees working remotely are encouraged to take steps to create boundaries between work and personal time.</p><p>8. Reporting concerns</p><p>Employees will not be reprimanded for failing to answer phone calls, emails, or messages outside of their normal working hours.</p><p>If you encounter problems in availing of your right to disconnect, please speak to your manager, a HR colleague or a colleague that you feel comfortable to do so. If you feel that you cannot approach the person directly, then you should approach your manager or another line manager, or a member of the HR Team with the objective of resolving the issue quickly and informally.  If an informal process has not been successful in resolving the concern, then the formal College grievance procedure may be utilised.</p><p>These guidelines should be read in conjunction with our other relevant policies e.g. Dignity at Work.</p><p>We reserve the right to amend and update this policy over time in line with best practice, learnings and any changes in legislation.</p>"}

For queries relating the this guide, please contact registrarsoffice@ncirl.ie</p><p>Quick Start Guide For Students</p><p>Although full details are fleshed out in the article below, this section provides a high level overview of the process for a student who has been referred for a suspected case of Academic Misconduct.</p><p>The lecturer will invite the student to meet.</p><p>If suspicions are confirmed or remain; the lecturer will seek a second opinion of a qualified staff member.</p><p>If second opinion agrees; the lecturer refers the student through the Academic Integrity Form to the Registrar's office.</p><p>The Registrar's office and lecturer will agree a provisonal sanction, which will be emailed to the student. The student may then:</p><p>A) If sanction is at levels 1-3 the learner has the opportunity to 'reject' the sanction and request a hearing of the Academic Integrity Panel.</p><p>B) Accept the sanction. The Lecturer who referred the student will confirm the next steps and resubmission details.</p><p>C) If the sanction is deemed to be at Level 4, or the student is in award year, the student must attend an Academic Integrity Panel hearing who will speak with the student and decide an appropriate action.</p><p>The decision of the Academic Integrity Panel will decide the ultimate sanction for cases at L4 or Award Year. The student may still appeal this decision to the Appeals Committee.</p><p>Suspected Incidents of Academic Misconduct</p><p>Any behaviour or action which contravenes academic integrity and breaches its fundamental values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility, and courage is considered to constitute Academic Misconduct.</p><p>NCI reserves the right to avail of any technological or other means available to it to detect suspected occurrence(s) of plagiarism or any other act of academic misconduct in respect of any assessment or other academic activity undertaken by any of its learners.</p><p>When a suspected incidence of academic misconduct occurs during an examination setting, it will be addressed in accordance with the College’s Examinations and Assessment Regulations.</p><p>Where a suspected incidence of academic misconduct by any learner other than in an examination occurs, it will be investigated in accordance with the provisions of the Academic Integrity Policy.</p><p>Where a suspected incidence of academic misconduct comes to the attention of any member of the College’s staff, they are required to notify the relevant authority such as the Programme/ Course Director, Lecturer or equivalent in the School in which the learner is enrolled.  Following an assessment of the suspected breach by the appropriate subject matter expert(s), the relevant Lecturer, School or Unit will refer the case via the Academic Integrity Form, which will calculate and classify the response/sanction (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, or Level 4) for the suspected breach in accordance with the criteria provided.</p><p>A note on AI/Plagiarism</p><p>Please note that the use of AI is not in and of itself academic misconduct. Depending on how/why AI is used in a student assignment, it may be classified under any of the 'Types of Concern' below. For instance if a student uses AI to write an essay without their own significant input into the work, this would be deemed as plagiarism, not a seperate 'AI use' categorisation. Similarly, if a student were to falsify research results/data, this would be classed under the 'Falsification / Fabrication' category below.</p><p>Students must disclose when they use AI, and must be given the opportunity to do so via the Project Cover Sheet which contains a section for referencing AI usage.</p><p>Student guidance for the use of AI in assignments can be found here.</p><p>The college reserves the right for lecturers to ask students to attend a viva to explain their work at any point.</p><p>Response to Academic Misconduct (outcomes & consequence)</p><p>Academic misconduct includes offences such as plagiarism, collusion, falsification, and cheating in any undergraduate or postgraduate assessment or assignment. In cases of suspected academic misconduct, the lecturer responsible for assigning and/or grading the relevant assessment completes the Academic Integrity Form. The form calculates an indicative score according to the suspected severity of the offence. The score determines the recommended consequences.</p><p>In all cases, the lecturer will inform the student of the suspected academic misconduct and invite the student to meet with them. If suspicions of academic misconduct persist after the meeting, or if the student does not attend, the lecturer will seek the opinion of another qualified staff member, and if in agreement that there is academic misconduct, the lecturer will then use the academic integrity form to calculate the level of misconduct and to inform the office of the Registrar.</p><p>If for any reason the lecturer disagrees with the calculated outcome of the Academic Integrity form, they may reject the findings and discuss directly with the Registrar’s office. Likewise, if a student disagrees with the calculated outcome of the Academic Integrity form, they may reject the findings and discuss directly with the Registrar’s office.</p><p>The Schools may instead decide to have learner assignments not considered to be a valid submission; the lecturer may on reading the assignment decide that the learner has not answered the question or used sources not relevant. It is not marked and returned to the learner for resubmission.</p><p>Academic Misconduct/Dishonesty Types</p><p>Behaviours perpetrated by individuals or institutions that transgress ethical standards held in common between other individuals and/ or groups in institutions of education, research or scholarship[1]. Academic misconduct includes offences such as plagiarism, collusion, falsification including inappropriate AI usage and cheating in any undergraduate or postgraduate assessment or assignment.</p><p>In cases of suspected academic misconduct, the lecturer responsible for assigning and/or grading the relevant assessment will first meet with the student, and then complete the Academic Integrity Form. The form calculates an indicative score according to the suspected severity of the offence. The score determines the recommended consequences or ‘sanction’.</p><p>The ‘type of concern’ in the table below is a major step in the calculation of the severity and sanction of the misconduct.</p><p>Type of concern Description</p><p>Basic violations  Include, but are not limited to, submitting a limited portion of the same material more than once without prior authorisation; giving your own academic work to others even when doing so was not explicitly prohibited; attendance/participation points misrepresentation; violation of instructor policies if behaviour not listed elsewhere in the guidelines; poor academic writing skill e.g., poor referencing or the passing off of somebody else's ideas as if originally discovered by the learner, or small errors made through carelessness or misunderstanding</p><p>Limited plagiarism Includes, but is not limited to, presenting work / ideas taken from other sources without proper acknowledgement. Paraphrasing from sources without attribution; verbatim copying from sources without attribution when what was copied was not a critical aspect (key, central ideas) of the assessment and impacted less than 30% of the assessment; plagiarism that includes false citations; looking online for a solution to an assessment and copying part of that solution/answer. Self-plagiarism could also fall into this category.</p><p>Extensive plagiarism Includes, but is not limited to, plagiarism when the aspects copied are critical aspects of the assessment and/or constitute more than 30% of the assessment or impact the integrity of more than 30% of the assessment thus requiring a new assessment; extensively copying from another learner’s assessment without acknowledgment of their contribution;  plagiarism that includes false citations. Mosaic copying/ scaffolding/ substantial similarity: An unoriginal piece of writing composed of acknowledged or unacknowledged extracts from several different sources. Where the key points and structure of another person’s work have been used as a scaffold (framework) for your own work, without acknowledging the source. This is plagiarism. Self-plagiarism that constitutes more than 30% of the assessment would also fall into this category.</p><p>Collusion Undisclosed collaboration between two or more people on an assessment or task, which was supposed to be completed individually when clear information was provided to students. Collusion includes inappropriate or unauthorised collaboration by two or more people in the production and submission of assessment task; learners providing their work to another learner before the submission deadline, or for the purpose of the other learner’s plagiarism at any time. Allowing another (e.g., friend / relative /peer / tutor) to write / translate / significantly edit one's assessment without acknowledging that help.</p><p>Falsification / Fabrication Includes, but is not limited to, altering a graded assessment provided by another person and submitting for re-grade; fabricating data for a lab or research assessment; submitting data you didn't yourself collect; lying/giving a false excuse to miss or receive unfair accommodation on an assessment. Types of major misconduct in an education, research or scholarship setting: Forging educational, research or scholarship content, images, data, equipment or processes so that they are inaccurately represented. Fabrication: Fabrication in the context of research means making up data, experiments, or other significant information in proposing conducting or reporting research.</p><p>Exam Cheating (including online and in class exams) Action or behaviour that violates rules in an attempt to give one learner an unfair advantage over another. Exam cheating includes, but is not limited to, copying from another person or allowing another person to copy during an examination; having an unapproved aid directly related to the exam (e.g., ‘cheat sheets’; course-related notes; textbook; whether electronically or hard copy); having ubiquitous smart technology (e.g., mobile phone, smart watch) accessible during an exam.</p><p>Fraud / Impersonation Actions that are intended to deceive for unfair advantage by violating academic regulations. Using intentional deception to gain academic credit. Fraud includes some of the most egregious violations – e.g. stealing or fraudulently obtaining answers to an assessment prompt/exam before submitting the assessment for grading; changing/helping to change any recorded assessment or course grade on an instructor's or university record; illicitly obtaining an assessment completed by another (without their knowledge) and submitting it (in part or whole) as one's own; submitting fake or false documents (e.g. medical notes)</p><p>Contract Cheating Form of academic misconduct when a person uses an undeclared and/or unauthorised third party, online or directly, to assist them to produce work for academic credit or progression, whether or not payment or other favour is involved. Contract cheating is any behaviour whereby a learner arranges to have another person or entity (‘the provider’) complete (in part or total) an assessment (e.g. exam, test, quiz, assessment, paper, project, problems) for the learner. If the provider is also a student, both students are in violation.</p><p>[1] Academic Integrity: National Principles and Lexicon of Common Terms, (2021) NAIN. P13</p><p>Sanctions</p><p>In all cases below where a student is referred through the Academic Misconduct form, and the case is upheld, the student will receive an outcome email, and the details of the academic misconduct are added to their student record for the duration of their enrolment in the programme.</p><p>At Levels 1-3 Learners may choose to reject the findings of the Academic Misconduct and request a hearing by the Academic Integrity Panel.

NCI takes learner complaints & grievances seriously and endeavours to improve its processes and services by supporting learners in expressing their dissatisfaction and seeking resolution to problems encountered.</p><p>A complaint \"is an expression of dissatisfaction by one or more members of the public about an organisation’s action or lack of action, or about the standard of service provided by or on behalf of the organisation”.</p><p>A grievance is an informal expression of dissatisfaction.</p><p>To ensure that learners have an appropriate means of lodging formal complaints & informal grievances that cannot be remedied via any other local mechanisms, NCI has developed the following student complaints & grievances procedure.</p><p>NCI’s “Learner Complaints & Grievances Procedure” seeks to provide a system to resolve legitimate complaints in a timely fashion. Such complaints & grievances can relate to the delivery of academic programmes (wide-ranging in scope) and/or the provision/availability of services. Most concerns can be successfully addressed and remedied through informal means, i.e., before a formal complaint is made. However, if informal resolution is unsuccessful or not to the satisfaction of the learner, the formal procedure can be pursued. NCI will follow the College Data Protection policy1 when investigating and retaining information about individuals within formal complaints.</p><p>Complaints & grievances should only be made by the impacted individual, and not by someone else on their behalf, even with their prior consent. The exception to this is whereby a complaint or grievance is shared by multiple learners (Section 5.1.3.1).</p><p>All complaints and grievances will be handled with sensitivity and discretion, and access to information about individual investigations will only be shared with those with a legitimate access requirement. All staff and learners who become aware of any of the issues involved in a formal complaint are required to keep this information confidential, except insofar as is necessary to progress, investigate or respond to the complaint. Data collected as part of a complaint will be treated in accordance with Data Protection legislation and will be retained in keeping with the NCI’s records retention policy. Retaliation or victimisation as a result of a complaint will not be tolerated. Complaints & grievances found to be malicious or vexatious will be dealt with under the College’s disciplinary procedures. NCI takes genuine learner complaints & grievances seriously and supports learners in seeking a resolution to their dissatisfaction. The Learner will not be discriminated against or suffer any recrimination as a result of making a legitimate complaint.</p><p>5.1.1 Scope</p><p>The “Learner Complaints & Grievances Procedure” can be used to submit a complaint about any aspect of NCI’s academic provisions and/or any other service provided directly by the College. The procedure does not, however, cover the following categories, for which separate procedures exist (if you need any more information on these procedures, please visit the appropriate section of this document outlined below:</p><p>Grievances relating to personal harassment or discrimination on the grounds of gender, civil status, family status, age, disability, race, religious belief, sexual orientation or membership of the traveling community (Section Error! Reference source not found.);</p><p>Requests for reviews of academic decisions (Chapter 4: Assessment) ;</p><p>Complaints relating to the Students' Union (Contact president@ncisu.ie); and</p><p>Appeals against decisions taken under disciplinary proceedings (Section Error! Reference source not found.).</p><p>https://www.ncirl.ie/Legal/Privacy#la-7362761-1-introduction</p><p>The “Learner Complaints & Grievances Procedure” is available for learners currently enrolled on an NCI programme. Additionally, any individual who was a registered learner but who has graduated or otherwise left the College may also avail of the procedure providing that any such complaint is made within three months of the individual’s programme finish date and that the acts or omissions being complained have occurred whilst they were a registered learner. The following process is designed to resolve complaints or grievances as speedily and effectively as possible. The starting point is always to encourage the resolution of complaints or grievances through informal means, but the College provides a formal process where this proves unsuccessful or unsatisfactory to the complainant. All complaints, whether formal or informal, will be dealt with respectfully in the context of the College’s policies and according to the resources available.</p><p>5.1.2 Informal Grievance</p><p>To make an informal grievance, the learner should first address concerns directly to the person responsible to attempt to resolve the matter informally or discuss the concern with their Class Representative (If a Class Representative is not available, please contact the Students’ Union (SU)). Alternatively, the learner may ask their programme coordinator to discuss the grievance on their behalf.</p><p>If these options prove unsuccessful or unsatisfactory, the learner should then approach the person responsible for the programme or service unit about which the learner has made the complaint. This may be the learner’s Programme Director or Dean of School, or the relevant Head of Service Unit (All staff members details will be provided in the Learner Handbook and on Moodle). If the Learner needs help in expressing their concern or is reluctant to approach the person(s) responsible for the programme or service/unit, they can seek advice from the SU Welfare or Academic Affairs Officers or the Student Services Team. Contact information can be found here; https://www.ncirl.ie/About/A-Z-Staff-Directory. The learner can also seek advice from the Students’ Union Executive if they are not sure who the appropriate person is.</p><p>5.1.3 Formal Complaint</p><p>If it is not possible to resolve the issue informally, the learner can lodge a formal complaint with the Registrar through the Student Hub. This formal complaint must be submitted by filling in the learner complaint form.</p><p>All formal complaints must be identifiable; therefore, the complaint or grievance cannot be anonymous at the point of submission. All complaints will be handled with sensitivity and discretion, and access to information about individual investigations will only be shared with those with a legitimate access requirement. Access requirements may be denied by the registrar to maintain confidentiality of the learner where appropriate. The College will never seek information from confidential services e.g., counselling & disability, without the consent of the complainant, unless there is a serious risk of harm or danger to the individual, other learners, or staff members. The level of risk will be assessed by the Registrar along with the heads of counselling and disability services.</p><p>All complaints will go to the Registry Office through the Student Hub. As part of the investigation process, the Registrar will inform key individuals including Deans and Heads of Units where appropriate.</p><p>5.1.3.1 Collective Grievances/Complaints</p><p>Where a complaint or grievance is shared by multiple learners, learners can also raise this as a group through the class rep, if a class rep has been elected. If a class rep has not been elected, the collective group or their nominated representative should follow the mechanisms outlined above or contact the Students’ Union (SU). Learners can also choose to raise their concerns as an individual using the steps above.</p><p>5.1.3.2 Acknowledgement of Complaint, Investigation and Response</p><p>The Registrar will appoint a person to lead the investigation and a report from the investigation will inform the decision of the Registrar. The learner can expect to receive a written acknowledgement of their complaint within 48 hours (excluding weekends/bank holidays where the learner would receive an acknowledgement the next working day after the weekend/bank holiday) of its receipt with an estimated investigation and response timeframe of no more than 15 working days. The Learner will be kept updated throughout the investigation phase. They can also expect to be kept informed if there is undue delay in coming to an appropriate resolution. The Learner will also be kept informed of any decisions to refer the complaint to a suitable staff member or to another office for redress, or to pursue and remedy the complaint according to another College procedure.</p><p>The learner’s complaint will be investigated as quickly as possible. The investigation may include individual face-to-face discussions with the complainant and the relevant staff member or head of service. All meetings will be minuted and shared with the complainant. The learner may be accompanied by a Tutor, Student Support officer, SU Officers for Welfare and Academic Affairs, etc. Any staff member can be accompanied by a staff rep of their choice. The Office of the Registrar will set out the structure of the meetings in advance with the Complainant and/or relevant staff member or head of service. Once the investigation has been completed, the complainant will receive a written response detailing the measures taken and what actions, if any, are to be taken. The response will be sent to the complainant from the Registrar. If the complaint is deemed malicious or fake, disciplinary action may be taken (See Section 5.10 Disciplinary Policy & Procedures). The Learner will not be discriminated or suffer any recrimination as a result of making a legitimate complaint.</p><p>5.1.3.3 Appeals</p><p>If the complainant is not satisfied with the decision of the Registrar, they can appeal by submitting the Appeals form on the Student Hub directly to the Office of the President.</p><p>Grounds for an appeal:</p><p>The Learner has the right to appeal the decision of the Registrar if they feel that the response did not adequately address the areas of the complaint or if there was a procedural irregularity during the investigation.</p><p>The President or the Vice-President would then appoint a neutral/independent member of the NCI Executive (that has not been involved in the case) to review the investigation completed on behalf of the Registrar leading to the decision, as well as any additional information (oral or written) that was not considered by the Registrar. The outcome of this investigation would then be considered by an Appeals Panel comprised of the President and/or Vice President, SU President and the Executive member that conducted the investigation.</p><p>Note: The NCI President cannot be involved in complaints at an earlier stage. They are the final point of appeal within the College and complaints addressed to them that have not gone through the appropriate channels outlined above will be referred to the Registrar.</p><p>Appeal procedures:</p><p>Learner must submit an Appeal Form on the Student Hub which will be send directly to the Office of the President. The Appeal Form must be submitted within 10 working days of receiving the written complaint response.</p><p>Receipt of the appeals complaint form to be acknowledged within 48 hours ((excluding weekends/bank holidays where the learner would receive an acknowledgement the next working day after the weekend/bank holiday) along with next steps and that update will be communicated within 15 working days (inclusive of post the 48 hours acknowledgement). Learners will be kept updated throughout the appeals process and the 15 working days is to be used as an absolute maximum rather than the norm.</p><p>The appeal will be investigated by a member of the NCI Executive appointed by the President or Vice President. Their role is to review and consider anything new at this phase.</p><p>At all stages in this process, the President or their investgator could ask to meet with the complainant or any other individuals involved in the formal complaint investigation and they will at all times have the right to be supported by a colleague or an SU Sabbatical Officer (Not the SU President as they will need to be part of an Appeals Panel with the president/Vice-President).</p><p>The group will be provided with a written report outlining the handling of the complaint, appeal documentation submitted by the Learner and gather additional evidence where applicable.</p><p>Individual interviews may be conducted with the Learner and others involved where necessary.</p><p>A learner may be accompanied by a Tutor, Student Support officer, member of SU, etc.</p><p>Any staff member invited to a meeting with a complainant can be accompanied by a staff rep of their choice.</p><p>A written report will be issued by the group. The report will be approved by the Registrar/Director of Student Registry and provided to the Learner within the 15 working days. Learner is given 10 working days to respond and if not fully satisfied, they can be referred to the Ombudsman.</p><p>5.1.3.4 Monitoring and Feedback</p><p>All formal complaints will be monitored by the Registrar, with annual reports provided to the President and presented to the Academic Council for consideration. Data and trends arising from formal and informal complaints and appeals will be gathered and analysed annually by the Office of the registrar to inform decision making at a programme, School and institutional level. An annual report will be produced to be considered by Academic Council. This monitoring process is part of the College’s efforts to continually improve its academic provisions, administrative processes and delivery of services to all cohorts of learners.</p><p>5.1.3.5 Referral to Office of the Ombudsman</p><p>If a learner has exhausted NCI’s internal complaint procedure and remains dissatisfied with the proposed recommendations, remedies offered or how the complaint itself was handled, they are entitled to refer their complaint to the Office of the Ombudsman (OO) in Ireland.</p><p>The OO will seek to determine if there was any maladministration in the handling of the complaint and, if yes, the effects of this maladministration. While the OO handles complaints and determines appropriate redress first and foremost, its secondary role is to drive improvements in public administration and ensure institutional learning to prevent recurrence.</p><p>If the OO decides to carry out an investigation, they must inform both the complainant and NCI of the results. NCI must also be afforded an opportunity to consider the matter and make representations before any adverse finding or criticism is made.</p><p>The Ombudsman may investigate any action taken by or on behalf of NCI in the performance of administrative functions if that action has resulted in an adverse effect, intended or otherwise. These actions must have been either:</p><p>taken without proper authority</p><p>taken on irrelevant grounds</p><p>the result of negligence or carelessness</p><p>based on erroneous or incomplete information</p><p>discriminatory</p><p>based on an undesirable administrative practice</p><p>a failure to comply with section 4A of the legislation or</p><p>otherwise, contrary to fair and sound administration</p><p>A complaint is excluded from the OO’s jurisdiction if a person has already initiated court proceedings or has a right of appeal to another body; the complaint was not made within 12 months of the action occurring; or the complaint relates to the terms and conditions of employment.</p><p>Appendix 1</p><p>Student Complaints Form</p>"}

Introduction</p><p>The aim of this policy is to indicate what constitutes harassment, sexual harassment and bullying, and to clarify what action the College will take when responding to breaches of this policy.</p><p>This policy defines each of the terms harassment, sexual harassment, and bullying. It provides general information and guidance to students at the College and sets out the procedures for processing of complaints where unacceptable behaviour is alleged to have occurred. These complaints may include unacceptable behaviour of students in relation other students, staff members or visitors to the campus of NCI. Complaints in relation to staff members of NCI are handled under the Dignity at Work policy.</p><p>The College in developing and implementing this Policy has had regard to and will have regard to the law and the codes of practice on bullying and harassment published from time to time by the Health and Safety Authority, the Department of Higher Education and the Equality Authority or any other appropriate body and agencies.</p><p>Students have a responsibility to create and contribute to the maintenance of an environment free from bullying and harassment or from conduct likely to contribute to bullying and harassment. Management and employees of the College will take appropriate measures to ensure that bullying/harassment do not occur, such as:</p><p>Providing a good example by treating all in the College with courtesy and respect.</p><p>Promoting awareness of the policy and the complaints procedures.</p><p>Being vigilant for signs of harassment and bullying and act before a problem escalates.</p><p>Dealing sensitively with a student who makes a complaint of bullying or harassment.</p><p>Explaining the procedures to be followed if a complaint is made to them.</p><p>Ensuring that an accused person is treated fairly.</p><p>Ensuring that students making a complaint are not victimised for doing so; and</p><p>Monitoring and following-up after a complaint are made to ensure that harassment or bullying is not recurring.</p><p>2. Statement of Policy</p><p>National College of Ireland (“NCI” or the “College “) is committed to the promotion and management of an environment for work and study which upholds the dignity and respect due to everyone. The College supports every individual’s right to study and work in a climate which respects their individuality and diversity, and, in an environment, which is free from threat, harassment, intimidation, and victimisation or bullying.</p><p>Sexual harassment, harassment or bullying in any form is totally unacceptable. The College will not tolerate any member of the NCI community, students, staff or anyone approved/contracted to work for or within the College, regardless of their position, being treated with anything less than professional courtesy and respect. Neither will NCI tolerate any member of the College, regardless of their position, treating students, staff or anyone approved/contracted to work for or within the College, with anything less than professional courtesy and respect.</p><p>This policy is guided by the general principle that the intention of the perpetrator of harassment or bullying is irrelevant. It is the effect of the behaviour on the individual that is important. In this regard therefore, it is the responsibility of all students and staff to be alert to their obligations under this policy and the possible effect of their behaviour on others and to manage such interactions positively.</p><p>A complaint of sexual harassment, harassment or bullying by or against a student may, following investigation, lead to disciplinary action. Disciplinary action may include a range of responses, from verbal warnings to expulsion.</p><p>3.  Scope of this Policy</p><p>This Policy applies to all students of the College in all locations (including the College campus; the campus of any other partner Institute / College; or such other place where students may be representing the College or participating in their capacity as College members at events such as social functions, events organised by the NCI Students Union, conferences, sporting events, field trips, or work assignments which are related to the College, to one’s study) and in all situations including when one communicates in person, in writing, on the telephone, by e-mail or on the internet in any College related activity or situation. This policy applies to online as well as on-campus learning and teaching environments.</p><p>It is the policy of the College to protect freedom of expression and intellectual enquiry for all members of the College and to ensure, as far as possible, that such freedoms are exercised in such a way as not to interfere with the rights of others or breach this Policy or the laws of the State.</p><p>Appropriate disciplinary action, including expulsion for serious offences, will be taken against any student who breaches this policy.</p><p>The number of instances of reported bullying and harassment will be monitored, as well as how complaints are resolved. Such information will be used to evaluate this policy and the associated procedures to implement changes as appropriate. The policy will also be updated in line with changes in the law, relevant case law or other developments.</p><p>Students are informed of and must agree to the terms and conditions of this policy during the annual registration process. The policy is available online, with links provided to each student in their respective programme handbook.</p><p>4. Objectives of this Policy</p><p>The objectives of this policy are to:</p><p>Promote awareness of unacceptable behaviour by way of direct communication and workshops, and to provide training, where appropriate.</p><p>Enable NCI to deter and detect unacceptable behaviour and to help create an environment where staff, students, contractors, and clients of the College can interact together free from sexual harassment, harassment or bullying in any form, in conjunction with other policies such as Dignity at Work.</p><p>Provide a clear mechanism for resolving allegations of sexual harassment, harassment or bullying.</p><p>5. Definitions</p><p>The following definitions are drawn from current legislation and relevant codes of practice and are intended to provide a frame for acceptable behaviour in the workplace.</p><p>The Employment Equality Acts 1998 and 2015 do not prohibit all relations of a sexual or social nature. It is the unwanted nature of the conduct which distinguishes sexual harassment and harassment from friendly behaviour which is welcome and mutual.</p><p>Sexual harassment, harassment or bullying is defined by the impact of the behaviour on the recipient and not necessarily by the intention of the perpetrator.</p><p>5.1 Harassment</p><p>Harassment is defined in the Employment Equality Acts 1998 and 2015 as:</p><p>“any form of unwanted conduct related to any of the discriminatory grounds” namely:</p><p>Gender</p><p>Civil status</p><p>Family status</p><p>Sexual orientation</p><p>Religious belief</p><p>Age</p><p>Disability</p><p>Social Class</p><p>Race</p><p>Traveller community membership</p><p>The Acts provide a non-exhaustive list of unwanted conduct that may constitute harassment, namely “acts, requests, spoken words, gestures or the production, display or circulation of written words, pictures or other material.”</p><p>A single incident may constitute harassment. Many forms of behaviour can constitute harassment. The term includes examples like those below, although it must be emphasised that the list is illustrative rather than exhaustive.</p><p>Verbal harassment – spoken words, jokes, comments, ridicule or songs, or jokes about a person’s membership of a protected category, demeaning and derogatory remarks, name calling, unwelcome comments, unwarranted criticism of work/study performance etc. that is related to one or more of the discriminatory grounds.</p><p>Written harassment – including emails, notices, social media posts, electronic text messages, internet chat and IM interactions etc. that is related to one or more of the discriminatory grounds.</p><p>Physical harassment – jostling, shoving or any form of assault that is related to one or more of the discriminatory grounds.</p><p>Intimidatory harassment – postures, posturing or threatening poses that is related to one or more of the discriminatory grounds.</p><p>Visual display such as posters, emblems or badges that is related to one or more of the discriminatory grounds.</p><p>Isolation or exclusion from social activities, or in workplace activities or course of study that is related to one or more of the discriminatory grounds.</p><p>Pressure to behave in a manner that the employee thinks is inappropriate, for example, being required to dress in a manner unsuited to a person’s ethnic or religious background, or otherwise that is related to one or more of the discriminatory grounds.</p><p>5.2 Sexual Harassment</p><p>Sexual Harassment is defined in the Equal Status Act as any form of unwanted verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature which has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity and creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for the person. A single incident may constitute sexual harassment.</p><p>Many forms of behaviour can constitute sexual harassment. Examples include:</p><p>Physical conduct of a sexual nature which may include unwanted physical contact such as unnecessary touching, patting, or pinching or brushing against another employee’s body, assault, and coercive sexual intercourse.</p><p>Verbal conduct of a sexual nature including unwelcome sexual advances, propositions, requests or pressure for sexual activity, continued suggestions for social activity outside the workplace after it has been made clear that such suggestions are unwelcome, unwanted, or offensive flirtations, suggestive remarks, innuendos, or lewd comments.</p><p>Non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature which may include the display or sending of pornographic or sexually suggestive pictures, calendars, objects, written materials, e- mails, text messages or faxes. It may also include leering, whistling, or making sexually suggestive gestures.</p><p>The Acts do not prohibit all relations of a sexual or social nature. To constitute sexual harassment or harassment the behaviour complained of must firstly be unwelcome.</p><p>It is up to each student to decide</p><p>what behaviour is unwelcome, irrespective of the attitude of others to the matter and</p><p>from whom, if anybody, such behaviour is welcome or unwelcome, irrespective of the attitudes of others to the matter.</p><p>The fact that an individual has previously agreed to the behaviour does not stop the individual from deciding that it has become unwelcome. It is the unwanted nature of the conduct which distinguishes sexual harassment and harassment from behaviour that is welcome and mutual.</p><p>The intention of the perpetrator of the harassment or sexual harassment is irrelevant. The fact that the perpetrator has no intention of sexually harassing or harassing the individual is no defence. The effect of the behaviour is what is relevant. Sexual harassment, harassment or bullying is defined by the impact of the behaviour on the recipient and not necessarily by the intention of the perpetrator.</p><p>If the individual is below 18 years of age or is a vulnerable adult and conduct of a sexual nature occurs, the College’s Child Protection Guidelines and Principles for the Protection of Vulnerable Adults should be referred to for further guidance.</p><p>5.3 Gender-based Harassment</p><p>Gender-based harassment is aggression, intimidation, or hostile conduct based on sex-stereotyping, sexual orientation or gender identity, but not involving conduct of a sexual nature. For example, persistent disparagement of a person based on a perceived lack of stereotypical masculinity or femininity or exclusion from an activity based on sexual orientation or gender identity also may violate this Policy.</p><p>5.4 Bullying</p><p>Bullying is defined as, repeated inappropriate behaviour, direct or indirect, whether verbal, physical or otherwise, conducted by one or more persons against others, at the place of study/work and/or in the course of employment, which could reasonably be regarded as undermining the individual’s right to dignity and respect.</p><p>An isolated incident of the behaviour described in this definition may be an affront to dignity at work, but as a once-off incident is not considered to be bullying.</p><p>Bullying can include verbal, gesture or physical bullying, exclusion or extortion.</p><p>A pattern of the following behaviours are examples of types of bullying. This list is not exhaustive and includes behaviour towards other students, employees and non-employees of the College.</p><p>Many forms of behaviour can constitute bullying. The term includes:</p><p>Verbal Abuse – shouting, spoken words, making jokes, undermining a person’s authority through misplaced and unwarranted criticism of an individual and their professional performance, ridiculing the employee or student in front of other employees and/or individuals, setting unrealistic and unattainable targets, spreading malicious rumours about an individual around the organisation, humiliation, sneering or ridicule and falling within the definition above.</p><p>Nonverbal Abuse – Looks, gestures, displaying emblems on clothing, exclusion, whistling, isolation at lunch breaks or social events, etc. and falling within the definition above.</p><p>Written Abuse – including emails, notices, electronic text messages, social media posts, emails, internet chat including IM interactions etc. and falling within the definition above.</p><p>Physical Abuse – Hitting, bodily contact that is abusive in nature, shaking fists in a threatening manner, sabotaging a colleague’s personal belongings etc. and falling within the definition above.</p><p>Cyberbullying refers to bullying which is carried out using the internet, mobile phone, or other technological devices. Cyberbullying generally takes a psychological rather than a physical form but is often part of a wider pattern of bullying behaviour.</p><p>As well as,</p><p>Exclusion with negative consequences</p><p>Being treated less favourably than others</p><p>Intrusion – pestering, spying, or stalking</p><p>Menacing behaviour</p><p>Intimidation</p><p>Aggression</p><p>Undermining behaviour</p><p>Humiliation</p><p>Persistent unjustified criticism or sarcasm</p><p>Blame for things beyond the person’s control</p><p>Individuals or groups of people can be responsible for or be the victims of bullying. It can occur between a student/supervisor or lecturer, between staff and students, between students and staff, and within peer groups.</p><p>5.5 Victimisation</p><p>Victimisation is defined as unfair treatment against a complainant in response to a complaint (both proven and accused), or in response to a belief that someone will make or has made a complaint. Someone who makes a complaint or who supports someone else’s complaint of harassment or bullying cannot be treated unfairly or less favourably based on this complain or support. This extends to witnesses who may be required to contribute to any formal procedures.</p><p>5.6 What Bullying, and Harassment is not</p><p>Lecturers and supervisors have responsibilities to provide academic guidance and advice to students. Such comment and advice may include critical statements and feedback along with monitoring and review of work and academic performance. The act of correcting students, pointing out areas for improvement, invoking performance counselling or misconduct procedures does not in itself constitute bullying or harassment.</p><p>Students involved in peer review, where the function is to provide academic guidance and advice to fellow students, which also may include critical statements and feedback, are also not engaging is harassment or bullying in fulfilling this role.</p><p>Bullying does not include reasonable and essential discipline arising from the good management of the performance or conduct of a student or actions taken which can be justified as regards the safety, health and welfare of students. For example, a student whose performance is continuously signalled at a level below that which is required may feel threatened and upset but this does not indicate bullying.</p><p>6.

Responsibilities, Monitoring and Review</p><p>8.1 Responsibilities</p><p>All staff and students have responsibility for building and maintaining a work and study environment that is free of sexual harassment, harassment or bullying by committing themselves to:</p><p>Consciously, through their own behaviour, attitude, and example, creating a climate which is respectful, friendly, and supportive of those seeking to discharge their duties and obligations in an environment which respects the unique contribution that everyone can make to the College and the wider community.</p><p>Discharging a leadership role within the College in support of this policy statement by taking immediate and positive action, and not accepting any aggressive or unacceptable behaviour, either directed to themselves or others within the College.</p><p>Cooperating as necessary and in full with an investigation or formal process whether as a complainant, an accused person, or as a witness.</p><p>Individual students and staff have a responsibility not to participate in discriminatory, harassing or victimising behaviour within the workplace or learning environment and to behave in a respectful, tolerant and equitable manner to all members of the College community.</p><p>8.2 Monitoring</p><p>Specific responsibility attaches to the Executive, Heads of Academic Departments, Central Service Managers, Senior Academic Staff, Supervisory Staff and Staff Representatives to set and maintain standards of behaviour and implement the provisions of this Policy, to underpin a positive work and study environment in the College.</p><p>The Registrar will have responsibility for monitoring the implementation of this Policy and ensuring that it is effective.

Bullying and Harassment Complaints Procedures</p><p>The College is actively committed to protecting the rights of both students and employees to achieve their full potential in an environment which values and affirms diversity and is free from bullying, harassment, victimisation and vilification. The College will take all reasonable steps and actions to ensure that Employees and Students will be treated fairly and with dignity and respect whilst working or studying at the College.</p><p>Complaints by students will be treated with fairness and sensitivity and in as confidential a manner as possible. Confidentiality will be maintained throughout the course of any investigation consistent with the requirements of a fair investigation.</p><p>Depending on the nature of a complaint, it may be possible to resolve the matter through informal or formal, investigative processes.</p><p>A student who makes a complaint in good faith, who supports a complainant, who gives evidence in proceedings or who gives notice that they intend to do any of the foregoing will not be victimised.</p><p>The College will ensure that both parties to the complaint receive appropriate support counselling or other intervention as appropriate.</p><p>No assumption will be made about the culpability of an alleged perpetrator while investigating a complaint.</p><p>9.1 Informal Procedures</p><p>If suitable, the student may wish to speak informally with the student/s accused of bullying or harassment.</p><p>Where a student finds it difficult and/or does not want to approach the other party directly they are able to seek support from a Designated Contact Persons for guidance. A student is under no obligation to take a first step of approaching the student who they feel are bullying or harassing them.  A Designated Contact Persons acts as an initial point of contact for student who believes that they are being treated in a way that constitutes bullying or harassment.</p><p>Should an informal process adequately resolve the matter, no further action will be taken.</p><p>Following an agreed resolution under informal procedures, consideration will be given to putting in place supportive interventions for the parties involved.</p><p>9.2 Formal Procedure</p><p>It is recognised that it may not always be appropriate to use the informal procedure. Also, if an early resolution cannot be achieved through the informal procedures, the matter will be dealt with under the formal procedures. Formal procedures will be used where bullying or harassment continues after an informal procedure has been followed or where the student making the complaint wishes it to be treated formally. Formal procedures involve submitting a formal complaint and a formal investigation.</p><p>Choosing not to use the informal procedure will not reflect negatively on a complainant in the formal procedure.</p><p>When a formal complaint is being made, then the student should contact the Registrar as soon as possible. If the complaint is against the Registrar, the Vice President Academic Affairs & Research should be contacted.</p><p>The complainant will make a formal complaint in writing which is signed and dated. The complaint document should be confined to the precise details of the alleged incidents, including dates and the names of witnesses, if any. Within 24 hours of receiving the complaint, the complainant will be informed of the next steps involved, timeframes and possible outcomes. This will include the Registrar completing, or commissioning, an investigation with an outcome report prepared within 5 working days. They will also be given a copy of the College’s Student Policy on the Prevention of Bullying and Harassment.</p><p>A meeting will be organised with the person against whom the complaint has been made. They will be given a copy of the complaint document and the College’s Student Policy on the Prevention of Bullying and Harassment. They will be informed of the steps involved, timeframes and possible outcomes of the investigation.</p><p>If a complaint of harassment or bullying is made against a person who is not a student or employee of the College and it transpires that it is not possible to secure their participation in either a formal or informal process, such individuals will be kept informed of any developments and given an opportunity to respond to them. The outcome of an investigation and any potential sanctions will be explained to such individuals and/or any person or company for whom they work.</p><p>The complainant and the person against whom the complaint has been made will have the right to appeal the Registrar’s decision via the Vice-President or President.</p><p>10. Making a Disclosure or Complaint of Sexual Assault, Sexual Harassment</p><p>Students can disclose or make a complaint of any incident of sexual assault, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and/or sexual exploitation to the College at any time.</p><p>The College recognises that the student can make these disclosure or complaint using their preferred method. Students can disclosure or make a complaint of sexual assault, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and/or sexual exploitation through the following options:</p><p>Students can talk to a member of the Student Services, the College Facilities Team, or NCI Student Union Official. A student is also able to make a disclosure to a fellow student or member of staff, which may be further referred to a member of Student Services with consideration for the wishes of the reporting student. Students abroad may also raise a complaint or disclosure to a member of NCI International.</p><p>Use the anonymous reporting tool.</p><p>Students can make a complaint to An Garda Siochana.</p><p>It is recognised that the reporting student may not seek to launch a formal investigation through this policy. In these instances, the College will provide counselling and wellbeing support to the reporting student.</p><p>In the following instances, the College is required to instigate a formal investigation regardless of the wishes of the reporting student:</p><p>An anonymous reporting is received which provides sufficient information to trigger an investigation, or the reporting party concedes anonymity to instigate an investigation.</p><p>The disclosure is of a nature where it is deemed to be an ongoing threat to the safety and security of other students.</p><p>The incident involves students representing the College internationally.</p><p>The incident involves both staff and students</p><p>If a complainant is under 18, or a Vulnerable Adult, the issue must be reported to NCI’s Designated Liaison Person (DLP), there are reasonable grounds for concern that a child may have been abused/is being abused or is at risk of abuse. The report should be made without delay to Tusla by the College’s DLP. Details are outlined in the NCI CHILD PROTECTION GUIDELINES & PRINCIPLES FOR THE PROTECTION OF VULNERABLE ADULTS Protocols and Procedures</p><p>When an individual who has experienced sexual assault, sexual harassment or sexual misconduct does not wish to make a formal complaint, does not want the College to take any action and/or withdraws their complaint, the College may still have an obligation to act to protect the safety and wellbeing of the College community and instigate an investigation. In this circumstance, the student will not be required to participate in the investigation, however, they may be informed about the outcome. They may be consulted on the outset of the investigation to agree to communication expectations.</p><p>The Registrar will commission an investigation, which will include the gathering of relevant documentation, witness statements and liaising with all relevant parties to complete the investigation.</p><p>11. Investigation</p><p>The investigation of any formal complaint will be handled with fairness, sensitivity and with due respect for the rights of both the complainant and the alleged perpetrator. The principles of natural justice will be adhered to when an investigation is being conducted.</p><p>The investigator may consult with/seek input from NCI staff, students or external legal guidance in the preparation of the investigation report and final recommendations.</p><p>Terms of Reference along the following lines will be established for the investigation:</p><p>The investigation will be conducted by <name>.</p><p>The scope of the investigation will cover the specific complaints made by <the Complainant> in his/her complaint document dated <date>.</p><p>In adhering to the principles of natural justice <the Respondent> will be furnished with documentation detailing the allegation and with all other information upon which the Investigator may rely on in arriving at a decision.</p><p>The <Respondent> will be given reasonable time to consider the documentation and an opportunity to respond in writing.</p><p>During the investigation, the Investigator will meet with <The Complainant>, and with any of his/her witnesses or relevant person(s). The Investigator will also meet with the <Respondent> and with any of his/her witnesses or relevant person(s). These meeting will take place on a one-to-one confidential basis.</p><p>The Investigator may also identify appropriate witnesses.</p><p>Copies of witness’ statements will be furnished to both the Complainant and the Respondent.</p><p>Both the Complainant and the Respondent may be accompanied at the investigative interview by another student, or a friend or a family member or a representative of the Students’ Union.</p><p>In the interests of the parties involved and in the interests of integrity of the investigation process, all parties to the investigation are expected to adhere to the highest standards of confidentiality regarding the content and process of the investigation. Confidentiality will be maintained throughout the investigation to the greatest extent consistent with the requirements of a fair investigation. For clarity, this means that the Complainant and the Respondent should not discuss any matter in relation to the investigation with any person other than their respective representatives or with the Registrar in the context of procedural matters. On no account should either party discuss subject matter, the investigation or the investigation process with a witness or potential witness. Similarly, witnesses should not discuss the subject matter, the investigation or the investigation process with any person other than the Investigator or the Registrar in the context of procedural matters.</p><p>Both the Complainant and the Respondent will be provided with a written record of all meetings, and any documentation or material in relation to the allegation and with all other information upon which the Investigator may rely on in arriving at a decision. Both parties will be given an opportunity to respond in writing, or if necessary, in person, to this material before the Investigator considers the evidence.</p><p>On completion of the investigation, the Investigator will furnish a written report containing the findings and the reasons for the final decision. In arriving at a conclusion, the Investigator will consider whether, on the balance of probabilities, the behaviours complained of occurred. Where a complaint is not upheld, the Investigator will consider, whether, on the balance of probabilities, the complaint was false, malicious or vexatious. A complaint not being upheld does not necessarily mean that the complaint was vexatious.</p><p>Where a complaint is upheld, the report will recommend whether the College’s Student Disciplinary Procedures should be invoked.</p><p>The Investigator will furnish the Report to the Registrar within 10 working days of the sign-off of final interviews. The timeframe for the investigation will be impacted by the availability of parties for interview and by the number of witnesses or parties for interview. The objective of the Investigator will be to complete the investigation and report as quickly as is practicable but depending on the circumstances it could take up to three months to complete from the date of the initial interview with the Complainant.</p><p>Representation</p><p>The complainant, the respondent and any witnesses have the right to be accompanied by another student or a friend or family member, or representative of the Students’ Union.</p><p>Outcomes from the Investigation</p><p>Where a complaint is upheld against a student, the matter may be dealt with under the College’s Student Disciplinary Procedures. This could lead to disciplinary sanctions up to and including expulsion being imposed. In the case on non-employees, sanctions could include the suspension of contracts or services, or exclusions from the College campus or other work environs or the imposition of other sanctions (as appropriate).</p><p>Complaints that are found to be false, malicious or vexatious may also be dealt with under the College’s Student Disciplinary Procedures.</p><p>A record of the investigation will be maintained by the Registrar in accordance with the Data Protection requirements.</p><p>Appeals</p><p>The College will respond to any comments submitted and will advise the parties of the appeals process.</p><p>The appeal will be heard by a party not involved in the investigation or not connected with any of the issues considered under the investigation.  An appeal would be reviewed /heard by the Vice President or in the case of a complaint against the Registrar – Chaired/heard by the president. An Executive Group member not included in the initial review might then be appointed to conduct a secondary investigation if needed to inform the appeal decision by the Vice President/President. The appeal will focus only on the aspect(s) of the case cited by the appellant as being the subject of the appeal.</p><p>Appeals arising from any Student Disciplinary Procedures initiated will be dealt with under that process.</p><p>Appendix 1: List and Role of NCI Designated Contact Persons</p><p>Name   Area  Email</p><p>Siobhán Canavan</p><p>Centre for Education and Lifelong Learning</p><p>siobhan.canavan@ncirl.ie</p><p>Sean Heeney</p><p>School of Computing</p><p>sean.heeney@ncirl.ie</p><p>Darragh Brien</p><p>Apprenticeship Co-ordinator</p><p>darragh.brien@ncirl.ie</p><p>Sara Ponce</p><p>Centre for Education and Lifelong Learning</p><p>sara.ponce@ncirl.ie</p><p>Midiane Sousa</p><p>Programme Co-Ordinator School of Computing</p><p>midiane.sousa@ncirl.ie</p><p>Meri Cvetkovska</p><p>Digital 4 Business</p><p>meri.cvetkovska@ncirl.ie</p><p>Victor Bassey Akpan</p><p>School of Computing Student</p><p>x22238361@student.ncirl.ie</p><p>Eoin Fitzsimons</p><p>School of Computing Student</p><p>x23151374@student.ncirl.ie</p><p>Arvind Puthenpurakkal Mahadevan</p><p>School of Business Student</p><p>x22242261@student.ncirl.ie</p><p>Caroline Smyth</p><p>School of Computing Student</p><p>x23183951@student.ncirl.ie</p><p>Designated Contact Persons</p><p>The College will appoint and train Designated Contact Persons (spanning staff and NCISU Representatives), who will be equitably distributed across all areas of the College to ensure all Students and Employees have ready access to a Designated Contact Persons.

INTRODUCTION</p><p>This Notice describes the practices of National College of Ireland (“NCI”) regarding the collection, use, transfer, disclosure and other handling and Processing of your Personal Data as an employee of NCI (and its affiliates).</p><p>In particular, NCI is committed to Processing the Personal Data of its employees in a fair, lawful and transparent manner. Accordingly, this Notice provides NCI employees with certain information about how their Personal Data is used by NCI. NCI has also adopted a Privacy Policy (the “NCI Privacy Policy”) that addresses data protection more generally. Capitalised terms used in this Notice are defined in the Glossary in Annex I to this Notice.</p><p>In relation to Personal Data provided by you to NCI, NCI will act as Data Controller of such Personal Data. This means that NCI determines why and how such data is used. NCI’s data Processing is generally undertaken in connection with the employment contract between each employee and the NCI.</p><p>2. WHAT IS PERSONAL DATA?</p><p>Personal data is any information relating to a living individual which allows either directly or indirectly the identification of that individual. Personal Data can include a name, an identification number, details about an individual’s location or any other detail(s) that is specific to that individual and that would allow the individual to be identified or identifiable.  The type of Personal Data that NCI collects and Processes in relation to employees is described in more detail in the table at Appendix II of this Notice.</p><p>3. HOW WE COLLECT AND USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</p><p>The table at Appendix II also describes in detail the particular purposes and lawful basis for NCI’s Processing of employee Personal Data as required by Data Protection Law. NCI will generally Process your Personal Data for personnel administration purposes and for purposes necessary for and connected with the performance of NCI’s legitimate interests.</p><p>NCI may obtain Personal Data about you from third parties, such as former employers, educational institutions, recruitment agencies, recruitment platforms such as LinkedIn, government agencies, from information in the public domain and available on the internet and from other employees (e.g., other NCI staff, supervisors, members of the HR Department, etc.).

Where we obtain Personal Data about you from third parties, we will do so in accordance with Data Protection Law.</p><p>4. SPECIAL CATEGORIES OF DATA</p><p>NCI Processes Special Categories of Data (“SCD”) relating to employees in limited circumstances, typically related to the ordinary course of personnel administration which is in accordance with the Data Protection Law.  Such Processing of SCD is permitted under several provisions of the Data Protection Law, including the following:</p><p>4.1 Article 9(2)(b) where it is “necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the controller or of the data subject in the field of employment and social security and social protection law in so far as it is authorised by Union or Member State law” and section 46 of the Data Protection Act 2018 which permits the processing of special categories of personal where the processing is necessary for the purposes of exercising or performing any right or obligation which is conferred or imposed by law on the controller or the data subject in connection with employment or social welfare law. As required by Data Protection Law, NCI applies suitable and specific measures in respect of such Processing.</p><p>4.2 Article 9(2)(f) GDPR where it is “necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims” and this ground is amplified under the Data Protection Act 2018 which permits the Processing of SCD where it is necessary for the purposes of providing or obtaining legal advice or for the purposes of, or in connection with, legal claims, prospective legal claims, legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings, or is otherwise necessary for the purposes of establishing, exercising or defending legal rights (and which may include Processing in the context of disciplinary proceedings);</p><p>4.3 Article 9(2)(g) GDPR which permits such Processing for reasons of substantial public interests and this is amplified under the Data Protection Act 2018 which provides a general lawful basis for Processing of SCD where it is necessary and proportionate for the performance of a function conferred by or under an enactment; and</p><p>4.4 In relation to the management of medical risk and medical claims, the Data Protection Act 2018 permits the Processing of SCD where it is necessary for the purposes of preventative or occupational medicine, to assess the working capacity of an employee, for the management of health or social care systems and services or for ensuring high standards of quality and safety of health care.</p><p>In addition, where NCI employees will be working in close proximity with children vulnerable persons, in accordance with the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions and Certain Disclosures) Act 2016, they NCI will require such employees to undergo Gard Vetting.</p><p>4.5 In relation to equality, diversity, and inclusion, as well as Athena Swan, Article 9(2)(j) of GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 allows the processing of SCD for statistical purposes.</p><p>5.

INTRODUCTION</p><p>In line with data protection requirements and good practice, National College of Ireland (‘NCI’) wish to put in place, and be able to demonstrate, appropriate and effective management of personal data throughout the Organisation.</p><p>NCI wishes to demonstrate commitment and compliance with the current Data Protection Acts and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Fundamental to the GDPR are the principles of accountability and transparency. This means that Controllers and Processors are both responsible and, accountable for the protection of personal data, and must be able to demonstrate how they maintain compliance with data protection requirements.</p><p>The implementation of an approved Data Protection Policy goes towards demonstrating NCI’s commitment to the protection of personal data, and provides a basis for maintaining and improving compliance with data protection requirements and good practice.</p><p>1.1 PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT</p><p>NCI collects, processes, and stores significant volumes of personal data and sensitive personal data (special category data) on an ongoing basis. NCI are committed to complying with data protection legislation and good practice.</p><p>The purpose of this document is to provide a statement of intentions and directions of NCI for managing compliance with data protection requirements which is formally approved by senior management. The aim of this policy is to ensure that any individual who handles personal data, whether they are a member of staff or a contractor, is fully aware of the requirements and act in accordance with data protection procedures.</p><p>The objectives of the data protection policy are to:</p><p>Enable NCI to meet its own requirements for the management of personal data.</p><p>Ensure NCI meets applicable statutory, regulatory, contractual and/or professional duties.</p><p>Protect the interests of individuals and other key stakeholders.</p><p>Support organisational objectives and obligations.</p><p>Impose controls in line with NCI acceptable level of risk.</p><p>This document also highlights key data protection procedures within NCI.</p><p>1.2 SCOPE AND CONSTRAINTS</p><p>This policy applies to all personal data processed by NCI, regardless of the media on which the personal data is stored (paper-based, electronic, CCTV or otherwise).</p><p>This policy applies to:</p><p>any person who is employed by NCI or is engaged by NCI, whether on a paid or voluntary basis, including contractor and sub-contractors, and who process personal data in the course of their employment or engagement.</p><p>Failure of any staff member or agent to comply with this policy may lead to disciplinary action being taken in accordance with NCI’s disciplinary procedures. Failure of a third party contractor/subcontractor to comply with this policy may lead to termination of the contract and/or legal action.</p><p>1.3 POLICY REVIEW, APPROVAL, AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT</p><p>In line with best practice, this policy has been approved by senior management, along with a commitment of continual improvement. This document will be reviewed at least annually by senior management and the NCI Data Protection Officer to ensure alignment to appropriate risk management requirements and its continued relevance to current and planned operations, legal developments, legislative obligations, and information commissioner guidance.</p><p>1.4 REFERENCES</p><p>General Data Protection Regulation</p><p>Data Protection Act 2018</p><p>E-Privacy Directive</p><p>S.I No. 336/2011 – European Communities (Electronic Communications, Networks, and Services) (Privacy and Electronic Communications) Regulations 2011</p><p>Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of “controller” and “processor” in the GDPR</p><p>Guidelines, recommendations, and best practice issued by the European Data Protection Board</p><p>This document forms part of the NCI Personal Data Management System, and should be read in conjunction with the other documents within the management system:</p><p>NCI Data Retention Policy (Document Reference: NCI-PDMS-03)</p><p>NCI Privacy Notice(s) (Document Reference: NCI-PDMS-04)</p><p>NCI Data Breach Incident Procedure (Document reference: NCI-PDMS-05)</p><p>1.5. DEFINITIONS</p><p>The following key GDPR terms and definitions are provided here for ease of use. For a complete list of definitions refer directly to the regulation (ref: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1465452422595&uri=CELEX:32016R0679).</p><p>‘Anonymisation’ is the process of turning data into a form which does not identify individuals and where identification is not likely to take place. This allows for a much wider use of the information.</p><p>'Personal Data' means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p><p>Recital 26 also clarifies anonymous information “The principles of data protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information, namely information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable. This Regulation does not, therefore, concern the processing of such anonymous information, including for statistical or research purposes”.</p><p>‘Special Categories of Personal Data’ refers to the  processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation.</p><p>NCI will avoid all processing of special categories of personal data where possible. It is understood that certain business activities within NCI require the processing of special categories of data (e.g. processing of data concerning health and disability). The general processing of special categories is prohibited in NCI, and in the rare instance it is required, Head of Departments must ensure all processing is defined in the data inventory, along with an appropriate legal basis (reference 1, Art 6), and derogation (reference 1, Art 9) for processing of such special categories recorded within the data inventory.</p><p>'Data controller' means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.</p><p>In certain instances, NCI alone determines the purpose and means of processing, and in other instances, NCI might jointly determine the purpose and means of processing with a third party. In both circumstances, NCI would be considered a controller of this information. Section 8 of this policy provides further information on the responsibilities of controllers, processors, and third parties.</p><p>‘Data subject’ any living individual who is the subject of personal data held by an organisation. Data subjects within NCI may include members of the public, students (current, past, and prospective), employees (current, past, and prospective), suppliers (e.g. sole traders or staff acting on behalf of the supplier), and other individuals such as external third parties, CPD members, and any other individual NCI might communicate with.</p><p>'Processing' means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.</p><p>'Processor' means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.</p><p>‘Third Party’ means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or body other than the data subject, controller, processor, and persons, who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data</p><p>‘Profiling’ means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person. This can include analysing or predicting aspects concerning a person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location, or movements.</p><p>‘Pseudonymisation’ means the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data is not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.</p><p>Examples of pseudonymisation within NCI may include the use of student IDs instead of student names for access authorisation. Where anonymisation cannot be used, the next best of pseudonymisation should be used.</p><p>'Recipient' means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing;</p><p>2. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p><p>All NCI staff and contractors are responsible for ensuring compliance with NCI’s data protection requirements and obligations. It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure:</p><p>They familiarise themselves with this policy and handle personal data in accordance with this policy, the data protection principles, and data handling rules.</p><p>They complete the mandatory data protection training provided. Data protection training is mandatory for all NCI employees. Annually, all NCI staff will have to complete this training and a record maintained for audit purposes.</p><p>Queries in relation to personal data are promptly and courteously dealt with. When an employee receives an enquiry about the handling of personal data, they must know what to do, and/or where to refer it.</p><p>To ensure all users are aware of their responsibilities as users of NCI systems, the following sections include additional requirements based on key data protection roles within NCI.</p><p>While all staff and agents of NCI have a responsibility to ensure data protection compliance, the following sections include additional requirements for key, specific data protection roles within NCI.</p><p>2.1 GOVERNING BODY AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT</p><p>The Governing Body and senior management are responsible for approving and reviewing this policy, and for mandating the allocation of appropriate resources to ensure its successful implementation. Each member of the Board is responsible for ensuring compliance with the Data Protection Acts and GDPR in their respective areas of responsibility.</p><p>2.2 DATA PROTECTION OFFICER</p><p>In line with the requirements of the GDPR and Data Protection Acts, NCI has appointed a Data Protection Officer. The individual performing the role of DPO must be suitably trained, independent, and of sufficient seniority to perform the tasks required. The role may be performed as a team function provided a single individual is the lead person “in-charge” and roles within the Data Protection Officer team are clearly defined.</p><p>Within NCI, our Data Protection Officer and the team may be contacted at:</p><p>Name: Niamh Scannell</p><p>Address:</p><p>Data Protection Officer</p><p>IFSC</p><p>Mayor Street</p><p>North Dock</p><p>Dublin 1</p><p>D01 Y300</p><p>Email: dpo@ncirl.ie</p><p>Telephone: (+353 1) 4498 523 or (01) 4498 523</p><p>The responsibility of the Data Protection Officer function within NCI is to:</p><p>Respond to individuals (data subjects) whose data is processed on all issues related to the processing of their data and the exercise of their data protection rights.</p><p>Cooperate with the Supervisory Authority, and act as the Organisation’s contact point for the Supervisory Authority on all issues related to the processing of Personal data in NCI.</p><p>Inform and advise NCI and its employees of their obligations pursuant to privacy regulations.</p><p>Monitor compliance with the data privacy obligations in relation to the protection of personal data, including the assignment of responsibilities, awareness-raising, and training of staff involved in processing operations and the related audits.</p><p>To provide advice and assistance regarding the requirement to perform Data Protection Impact Assessments, and monitor their performance.</p><p>Arrange at least annual data protection training sessions.</p><p>Maintain a log of all data breaches and communication of breaches to all relevant parties when required to do so (Supervisory Authority, Controllers, and Data Subjects). Please refer to Section 6 for more details.</p><p>To allow for the effective performance of the Data Protection Officer’s tasks, NCI will ensure:</p><p>The Data Protection Officer will be suitably trained and have expert knowledge of Data Protection Law.</p><p>NCI will support the Data Protection Officer in performing the tasks above by providing resources necessary to carry out those tasks. The key to this is to provide sufficient time, finance, and staff where appropriate to fulfil the Data Protection Officer duties.</p><p>No tasks and duties result in a conflict of interests for the Data Protection Officer.</p><p>That the Data Protection Officer is involved, properly and in a timely manner, in all issues which relate to the protection of personal data, and will be in a position to perform their duties and tasks in an independent manner. Specifically:</p><p>The Data Protection Officer will report directly to the NCI Board.</p><p>The involvement of the Data Protection Officer will be sought where decisions with data protection implications are taken. All relevant information must be passed on to the Data Protection Officer in a timely manner in order to allow him or her to provide adequate advice.</p><p>The Data Protection Officer will participate regularly in meetings with senior and middle management.</p><p>The opinion of the Data Protection Officer will always be given due weight.</p><p>The Data Protection Officer must be consulted without delay in the event of a data breach or other data protection incident occurring.</p><p>2.3. HUMAN RESOURCES</p><p>NCI human resources personnel have a key role in the management and protection of personal data which includes responsibility for:</p><p>Ensuring all new members of staff are made aware of this policy document at induction stage and that it is referenced in staff terms and conditions, contracts, and role descriptions.</p><p>Ensuring new starters and temporary staff who require training complete the first available data protection training course after their start date.</p><p>Handling all employee-related personal data in accordance with this policy, the data protection principles, and data handling rules.</p><p>2.4. HEAD OF FUNCTIONS AND DEPARTMENTS, BUSINESS OWNERS, LINE MANAGERS</p><p>Line Managers and Heads of Functions or Departments have a key role in the management and protection of personal data which includes responsibility for:</p><p>Ensuring all processing within their department is in compliance with the NCI Data Protection Policy and privacy best practice. Specifically, maintaining the data inventory of all information processed by their department, and for ensuring that staff in their area are aware of the policy, and the general obligations and requirements of data protection.</p><p>Ensuring their reporting staff complete the mandatory data protection training.</p><p>Ensuring sufficient resources are available to support the effective implementation of this policy.</p><p>Ensuring appropriate technical and organisational security measures, including anonymisation for statistical and research purposes, are in place in areas for which they are responsible. Specifically, security risk assessments will be undertaken to check that the personal data is sufficiently protected in line with security policy. Security risk assessments will be commissioned regularly and evidence retained for audit purposes. To deal with appropriate technical and organisational security measures, the Line Manager/Head of Function may delegate the security tasks, in full or partially, to another NCI representative. This delegation does not exempt the Line Manager/Head of Function from their responsibility and they must make sure that the delegated jobs have been carried out correctly.</p><p>Ensuring data privacy risks are appropriately managed within their function. Specifically, to ensure the handling of personal data is regularly assessed and evaluated. Under the GDPR, there are a number of changes which will affect both in-house changes and contracts for new projects. It is therefore important that if any new projects are being considered then data protection needs to be built in at the beginning (Privacy by Design and Default), and contracts will need to reflect the necessary changes.</p><p>Ensuring that where processing “is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons” and/or “processing on a large scale of special categories of data”, a Data Protection Impact Assessment is formally carried out in relation to each new project or proposal (see section 5 for more details on Data Protection Impact Assessment). The NCI Data Protection Officer must be consulted at each stage of the DPIA process in line with section 5.3 of this document.</p><p>Ensuring regular consultation with the Data Protection Officer, and facilitating the DPO in performing their compliance audits.</p><p>2.5 TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS ARCHITECTS/TECHNICAL DESIGN LEADS/PROJECT MANAGERS</p><p>Members of staff and other third parties involved in the planning, design, build, and change of technical solutions have a key role in the protection of personal data which includes:</p><p>Ensuring the protection of personal data is considered for all changes and managed projects within NCI.</p><p>Where changes and projects do not include the collection and processing of personal data, this must still be documented and signed off by the Project Manager, and retained as evidence for audit purposes.</p><p>Implementing the principles of data protection by design and data protection by default, and retaining evidence of this for audit purpose as part of the Project Management Lifecycle (see Section 5 for more details).</p><p>3. HOW NCI COMPLIES WITH THE DATA PROTECTION PRINCIPLES</p><p>NCI is committed to ensuring all personal data is processed in line with the data protection principles and good practices. This includes:</p><p>3.1 \"LAWFULLNESS, FAIRNESS, and TRANSPARENCY\"</p><p>Personal data shall be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject.</p><p>NCI is committed to ensuring the lawful, fair, and transparent collection of data. Our data inventory records all information processed, including the lawful basis of such processing. In addition, our privacy notice provides all necessary information to Data Subjects about the processing of their data. The information is given in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form, and includes the purposes of processing, the period of processing, their rights, and the lawful basis for the processing. These privacy notices must be provided to Data Subjects prior to collecting personal data regardless of the collection method (phone, CCTV, forms, interview, website etc.).</p><p>3.1.1 WHERE THE LAWFUL BASIS IS \"CONSENT\"</p><p>Where the lawful basis of processing is based on consent, NCI shall incorporate procedures for the obtaining and withdrawal of consent. Where consent is withdrawn, processing based on consent must cease. Specifically, where other departmental requirements or legislation require explicit consent (e.g. for marketing), the departments shall contain procedures for collecting this consent. The department must also monitor all requests for removal or withdrawals of consent, maintain a register of all such requests, and ensure that all removals are completed without undue delay.</p><p>Where processing on the lawful basis of consent, and the processing relates to a child (reference 2 – this is 16 years of age), the department must ensure they have obtained and recorded consent provided by the holder of parental responsibility for the child.</p><p>Refer to the NCI Data Protection Officer for further guidance, clarification, and consultation in relation to the lawfulness of processing, and conditions for consent.</p><p>3.2 \"PURPOSE LIMITATION\"</p><p>Personal data shall be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.</p><p>NCI is committed to only collect and process information for an explicit purpose. All information processed, along with the business purpose, is detailed within the data inventory which will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or when any significant changes occur to the data processed, where it is processed, or with whom it is shared.</p><p>Personal data will only be processed for the defined purpose. All requests for changes to the use of personal data must be compatible with the original purpose for processing. If additional purposes are required, consent may be required to be sought from the data subject for this change of purpose.</p><p>3.3 \"DATA MINIMISATION\"</p><p>Personal data shall be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.</p><p>NCI is committed to only collect and process appropriate information to the extent needed to fulfil the operational and service needs, and to comply with all applicable statutory, regulatory, contractual and/or professional duties. Data will be minimised, and the minimisation shall be enforced through Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs), and Data Protection by Design and Default procedures within the change management/project management teams.</p><p>3.4 \"ACCURACY\"</p><p>Personal data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay.</p><p>NCI is committed to taking all reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of the personal data. This will be planned for, and enforced, through DPIAs, and Data Protection by Design and Default procedures within our change management/project management teams.</p><p>3.5 \"STORAGE LIMITATION\"</p><p>Personal data shall be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the Personal data are processed.</p><p>NCI have documented the required data retention periods along with justification and action to be taken when the retention period expires. The Data Retention Policy outlines the retention period for all personal data across NCI, and what will occur when the retention period expires. It applies to all personal data, regardless of the media on which it is stored (paper-based, electronic, CCTV or otherwise). This policy helps ensure that NCI is maintaining the personal data for an appropriate length of time, based on legal and business requirements and in line with the data protection ‘storage limitation’ principle. All staff and contractors are responsible for ensuring this policy is adhered to.</p><p>3.6 \"INTEGRITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY\"</p><p>Personal data shall be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.</p><p>NCI is committed to protect and not disclose personal data, either within or outside of NCI, to any unauthorised recipient. All staff and contractors are responsible for protecting personal data against accidental loss, destruction or damage, regardless of the media on which it is stored (paper-based, electronic, CCTV or otherwise).</p><p>4. INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS</p><p>All data subjects have a wide array of rights in relation to the personal data which NCI process on their behalf. The GDPR creates some new rights for individuals and strengthens some of the rights that currently exist.</p><p>4.1 COMMON PROCEDURES TO EXERCISE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS</p><p>Any queries regarding data protection, or any requests for personal data, whether from the person themselves or from a third party, must be referred to the Data Protection Officer. Any person wishing to exercise this right must apply in writing (or email) to the DPO.</p><p>The procedure is as follows:</p><p>All data access requests directed to NCI must be in writing (or email), to the DPO. On receipt of a query or access request by telephone, please ask the caller to put their request in writing (or email), and to address it to the NCI Data Protection Officer.</p><p>The DPO will check the validity of the access request. The GDPR does not introduce an exemption for requests that relate to large amounts of data, however, all efforts will be made to try to narrow the search to provide the data subject with relevant and concise information and avoid a disproportionate effort. Where the request is considered excessive, unfounded, or information which the data subject already holds, consideration will be given as to the validity of the request.</p><p>The request must include sufficient identification and details for the DPO to satisfy themselves that sufficient material has been supplied to definitively identify the individual. If the DPO can demonstrate they are not in a position to identify the data subject, additional information will be requested as necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject and the request will not be enacted upon until such identification is provided to the DPO. Personal data should never be provided to a data subject that has not been identified, nor should personal data be provided to the parent or legal guardian of a data subject where that subject is 16 years or older (reference 2).</p><p>4.2 RIGHT TO ACCESS</p><p>Data subjects (including employees, students, other individuals and members of the general public that may have availed of NCIs services, or received communications or information from NCI) have the right to access personal data held about them (this includes factual information, expression of opinion, and the intentions of NCI in relation to them, irrespective of when the information was recorded).</p><p>Where the access request is relevant to a number of departments, the DPO will contact the relevant departments and request them, in writing, to conduct a search of all data held by them. Such searches will be conducted in accordance with guidance provided by the DPO, and all steps taken to locate and collate data will be noted and documented.</p><p>Each department must redact all information not relevant or not in scope for release. Where the department is unsure of what is relevant they must consult with the DPO. However, the responsibility for redacting irrelevant information remains with each department.</p><p>Once any required review and redaction are completed, the personal data that is recommended for disclosure/deletion will be forwarded to the DPO for consideration. Department responses must also include an analysis of the relevant exemptions being relied upon, a description of the purpose of processing, to whom the data may have been disclosed, and the source of the data.</p><p>If personal data relating to other parties (other than the requesting data subject) is involved, the personal data of the other parties must not be disclosed without their consent. Alternatively, the other party personal data may be anonymised so as not to reveal their identity. If an opinion of other parties (other than the requesting data subject) is involved, their opinion may be disclosed unless it is an opinion which was given in confidence on the clear understanding that it would be treated as confidential.</p><p>A final decision on disclosure/deletion of the requested information will be taken by the DPO, in conjunction with the head of the relevant department(s) and legal advice where required.</p><p>4.2.1 CCTV</p><p>CCTV footage is personal data within the meaning of the Data Protection Acts. Any disclosure of CCTV footage must follow the same procedure as stated in steps 1-5 stated above, and be approved by the DPO. The following provides the Irish Data Protection Commission’s position with regard to access to CCTV footage made under Subject Access Requests (reference DPC Annual Report Case Study 13 of 2013. This is available in the “pre-GDPR” section of their website):</p><p>Any person whose image is recorded on a CCTV system has a right to seek and be supplied with a copy of their own personal data from the footage.</p><p>When making an access request for CCTV footage, the requester should provide the data controller with a reasonable indication of the timeframe of the recording being sought - i.e. they should provide details of the approximate time and the specific date(s) on which their image was recorded. For example, it would not suffice for a requester to make a very general request saying that they want a copy of all CCTV footage held on them. Instead, it is necessary to specify that they are seeking a copy of all CCTV footage in relation to them which was recorded on a specific date between certain hours at a named location. Obviously, if the recording no longer exists on the date on which the data controller receives the access request, it will not be possible to get access to a copy. Requesters should be aware that CCTV footage is usually deleted within one month of being recorded.</p><p>For the data controller's part, the obligation in responding to the access request is to provide a copy of the requester's personal data. This normally involves providing a copy of the footage in video format. In circumstances where the footage is technically incapable of being copied to another device, or where the supply of a copy in video format is impracticable, it is acceptable to provide stills as an alternative. Where stills are supplied, it would be necessary to supply a still for every second of the recording in which the requester's image appears in order to comply with the obligation to supply a copy of all personal data held.</p><p>Where images of parties other than the requesting data subject appear on the CCTV footage, the onus lies on the data controller to pixilate or otherwise redact or darken out the images of those other parties before supplying a copy of the footage or stills from the footage to the requester. Alternatively, the data controller may seek the consent of those other parties whose images appear in the footage to release an unedited copy containing their images to the requester.</p><p>Where a data controller chooses to use technology to process personal data, such as a CCTV system to capture and record images of living individuals, they are obliged to shoulder the data protection obligations which the law places on them for such data processing. In the matter of access requests for CCTV footage, data controllers are obliged to comply fully with such requests. Claims by a data controller that they are unable to produce copies of footage or that stills cannot be produced from the footage are unacceptable excuses in the context of dealing with an access request. In short, where a data controller uses a CCTV system to process personal data, it takes on and is obliged to comply with all associated data protection obligations.</p><p>The following provides the UK Information Commissioners Office with regard to access to CCTV Footage made under Subject Access Requests Ref: https://ico.org.uk/media/1542/cctv-code-of-practice.pdf</p><p>When disclosing surveillance images of individuals, particularly when responding to subject access requests, you need to consider whether the identifying features of any of the other individuals in the image need to be obscured. In most cases the privacy intrusion to third party individuals will be minimal and obscuring images will not be required. However, consideration should be given to the nature and context of the footage.</p><p>Example: If footage from a camera that covers the entrance to a drug rehabilitation centre is held, then consider obscuring the images of people entering and leaving it as this could be considered sensitive personal data. This may involve an unfair intrusion into the privacy of the individuals whose information is captured and may cause unwarranted harm or distress. On the other hand, footage of individual’s entering and exiting a bookshop is far less likely to require obscuring.</p><p>Following the above, a case-by-case assessment is required as to the context of the CCTV. If unsure, please refer to DPO.</p><p>4.3 RIGHT TO RECTIFICATION</p><p>Data subjects (including employees, students, other individuals and members of the general public that may have availed of NCI’s services, or received communications or information from NCI) have the right to the rectification of any inaccurate personal data concerning him or her that is held by NCI. This applies if data is inaccurate or misleading to a matter of fact. This is not an absolute right, and restrictions apply. For example, it does not apply to witness statements or opinions of others such as assessors, etc. Refer the data subject to the DPO for all requests under the “Right to Rectification”.</p><p>In the case of backups, the right to rectification may not be practical or possible, and may therefore be exempt. This would depend on the backup types, and the DPO should be consulted if there is any uncertainty.</p><p>4.4 RIGHT TO ERASURE</p><p>Data subjects have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her where there is no longer a legal ground for processing of the information. This is not an absolute right, and restrictions apply. Refer the data subject to the DPO for all requests under the “Right to Erasure”.</p><p>In the case of backups, the right to erasure may not be practical or possible, and may therefore be exempt. This would depend on the backup types, and the DPO should be consulted if there is any uncertainty.</p><p>4.5 RESTRICTIONS</p><p>There are restrictions, and in certain circumstances, it may be prudent for NCI not to adhere to certain individual rights. The Data Protection Officer will consider each request on a case by case basis and it is likely that such restrictions would not apply to the complete data set and more likely to a restricted and very specific set of personal data. For example, NCI may not be permitted to apply a blanket exemption to the right of access to an entire set of a student’s data because some elements may be considered privileged, such as an opinion given in confidence regarding the student.</p><p>If NCI wishes to withhold certain subject rights, this must be referred to the DPO, who may seek legal counsel. Restrictions on exercise of data subject rights are laid out in the Data Protection Act (reference 2), and shall be considered carefully when performing data subject access requests.</p><p>It should be noted that the existence of proceedings between a data subject and the data controller, for any reason, does not preclude the data subject making a data subject access request under the Act, nor does it justify the data controller in refusing the request. For example, if a data subject access request is refused, a response clarification as to which exemption is being applied, including the specific restriction, must be cited.</p><p>5. INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY</p><p>The GDPR requires NCI to implement technical and organisational measures to ensure an appropriate level of security. NCI must take into account the current state and availability of security technologies, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. NCI must also ensure their processors also implement appropriate measures. Some examples of appropriate measures as mentioned in the Regulation are:</p><p>the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data;</p><p>the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;</p><p>the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident;</p><p>a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.</p><p>In assessing the appropriate level of security, account shall be taken in particular of the risks that are presented by processing, such as accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.</p><p>NCI fulfil these obligations by a number of means, specifically:</p><p>Deployment of Data Protection by Design and by Default within our Project Management Lifecycle for all new systems/changes to processing (reference Section 5.1 for further details).</p><p>Regular risk assessments/testing to assess and evaluate the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures on existing processing (reference Section 5.2 for further details).</p><p>Formalised Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) where processing “is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons” and/or “processing on a large scale of special categories of data” (reference Section 5.3 for further details).</p><p>Records of all of the above activities will be forwarded to the NCI Data Protection Officer and retained for audit purposes.</p><p>5.1 DATA PROTECTION BY DESIGN AND DEFAULT</p><p>The GDPR requires:</p><p>Taking into account the state of the art, the cost of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for rights and freedoms of natural persons posed by the processing, the controller shall, both at the time of the determination of the means for processing and at the time of the processing itself, implement appropriate technical and organisational measures, such as pseudonymisation, which are designed to implement data-protection principles, such as data minimisation, in an effective manner and to integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing in order to meet the requirements of this Regulation and protect the rights of data subjects.</p><p>The controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures for ensuring that, by default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed. That obligation applies to the amount of personal data collected, the extent of their processing, the period of their storage and their accessibility. In particular, such measures shall ensure that by default personal data are not made accessible without the individual's intervention to an indefinite number of natural persons.</p><p>As part of the implementation of Data Protection by Design and Data Protection by Default principles, a data protection and security design review will be performed during the development stage, and as part of the project management of all projects. The following is a minimum checklist for the areas that will be examined as part of this review, and records of the examination of each area must be maintained for audit purposes:</p><p>Has the Data Inventory been updated with any new forms of processing including data categories processed, where it is processed, and with whom it is shared?</p><p>Has a valid lawful basis for this processing been defined within the Data Inventory?</p><p>Do any new forms of processing include a relevant data privacy notice with all required information as defined in the NCI Data Privacy Notice(s) policy (reference NCI-PDMS-04)?</p><p>Is the information collected for a specifically defined purpose?</p><p>Is only the required information collected, or is information collected which may be deemed excessive (i.e. is the personal data that is collected minimised)?</p><p>How is the personal data kept reasonably accurate and up-to-date?</p><p>How long is the personal data retained for, and does the retention period and destruction method comply with the NCI Data Retention Policy (reference NCI-PDMS-03)?</p><p>Is it necessary for NCI to be able to identify the individuals whose data is being processed, or could anonymisation be used?</p><p>Could pseudonymisation be enforced to protect the personal data, for example, could individuals making enquiries regarding courses be restricted to a reference number until such time as they submit an application?</p><p>Can the personal data be encrypted at rest and/or in transit, and if not, are other security measures in place to adequately address the risks associated with the processing activity?</p><p>How is the information protected against unlawful or accidental loss, destruction or damage?</p><p>How does the new form of processing allow for the implementation of individual rights, including the right to access, rectification, and erasure?</p><p>Is all processing within the EEA?</p><p>Has a technical penetration test or risk assessment been performed and remediation actions were taken?</p><p>Are appropriate access controls in place? Specifically:</p><p>Is physical or remote access needed to the office in order to access the personal data?</p><p>Is user access restricted on a need-to-know basis?</p><p>Is all user access audited and do is there an audit trail of all user access?</p><p>Is there a formal process for joiners/movers/leavers to facilitate user access management?</p><p>Are user access reviews performed which are signed-off by relevant business owners and recorded for audit purposes?</p><p>Are other relevant and appropriate technical and organisational security measures applied? Specifically:</p><p>Is a formalised patching policy applied and maintained?</p><p>Are reliable and recent backups in place, and are these tested regularly?</p><p>Are all backups encrypted?</p><p>Are appropriate perimeter security controls applied?</p><p>Is appropriate anti-malware deployed?</p><p>Can personal data which is shared externally for reporting purposes, or retained for analytics/statistics, be anonymised?</p><p>5.2 REGULAR RISK ASSESSMENT</p><p>The GDPR Requires:</p><p>A process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.</p><p>It is the responsibility of the Head of the Department to ensure appropriate technical and organisational security measures are in place in areas for which they are responsible. Specifically, regular security risk assessments must be commissioned to check that the personal data is sufficiently protected based on the level of risk. Security risk assessments will be conducted regularly, and a record maintained for audit purposes with the output from each area examined. At a minimum, the risk assessment must evaluate and record the technical and organisational measures identified in the previous section (Section 5.1). Heads of Department may commission other NCI resources to assist with risk assessments.</p><p>NCI will ensure that any risks to the privacy of data are assessed, and that measures that are implemented are appropriate to the risks of the processing on the systems used. To facilitate this, each data category name, data store, and recipient/s (or third parties) are assigned a risk level based on a defined set of criteria for each department’s Personal Data Inventory.</p><p>5.3 DATA PROTECTION IMPACT ASSESSMENT (DPIA)</p><p>The GDPR requires that a formalised Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is performed where processing “is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons” and/or “processing on a large scale of special categories of data”.</p><p>A data protection impact assessment will be carried out by NCI prior to the processing of the personal data, paying particular attention to the likelihood and severity of the risk, taking into account the:</p><p>Nature</p><p>Scope</p><p>Context and purposes of the processing</p><p>The source of the risk</p><p>At a minimum, the DPIA will contain:</p><p>A systematic description of the envisaged processing operations and the purposes of the processing, including, where applicable, the legitimate interest pursued by the controller.</p><p>An assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing operations in relation to the purposes.</p><p>An assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.</p><p>The measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data and to demonstrate compliance with the Regulation, taking into account the rights and legitimate interests of data subjects and other persons concerned. (Note: the list provided for Data Protection by Design and Default will also be completed for the Data Protection Impact Assessment)</p><p>Where appropriate, NCI will seek the views of data subjects or their representatives on the intended processing, without prejudice to the protection of commercial or public interests or the security of processing operations.</p><p>It is the responsibility of NCI and its designated business owners, not the DPO, to carry out DPIAs as necessary. However, the DPO shall be consulted at each stage of the DPIA, and shall provide advice and guidance as follows:</p><p>whether or not to carry out a DPIA</p><p>what methodology to follow when carrying out a DPIA</p><p>whether to carry out the DPIA in-house or whether to outsource it</p><p>whether or not the DPIA has been correctly carried out and whether its conclusions are in compliance with the GDPR</p><p>whether or not prior consultation with the supervisory authority is required in line Article 36 of the GDPR following a review of the DPIA</p><p>whether or not to go ahead with the processing following a review of the DPIA</p><p>what safeguards to apply if processing does go ahead</p><p>All consultation with the DPO will be retained as evidence for audit purposes. Where the advice of the DPO is not taken, the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party: Guidelines on Data Protection Officers recommends that the reasons for not adhering to the advice of the DPO should be documented. NCI shall formally record these reasons in the DPIA documentation.</p><p>Further external guidance in the performance of a DPIA is provided by the following resources:</p><p>https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1595/pia-code-of-practice.pdf</p><p>https://www.cnil.fr/en/privacy-impact-assessment-pia</p><p>https://www.oaic.gov.au/resources/agencies-and-organisations/guides/guide-to-undertaking-privacy-impact-assessments.pdf</p><p>https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/guidance-and-advice/10-steps-to-undertaking-a-privacy-impact-assessment-poster/</p><p>http://www.pdp.ie/training/practical-guide-to-impact-assessments-data-protection-ireland-journal.pdf</p><p>6. PERSONAL DATA BREACH HANDLING</p><p>6.1 WHAT IS A PERSONAL DATA BREACH?</p><p>“Personal data breach” means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.</p><p>Example of typical data breaches are:</p><p>Loss or theft of data or equipment on which data is stored</p><p>Loss or theft of documents/folders</p><p>Unforeseen circumstances such as a flood or fire which destroys information</p><p>Inappropriate access controls allowing unauthorised use</p><p>A hacking/cyber attack</p><p>Obtaining information from the organisation by deception, misaddressing of e-mails, human error, etc.</p><p>The above examples include the accidental loss of personal data as statistics indicate that most breaches are internal in nature and due to non-malicious user behaviour (e.g. loss of unencrypted laptop or USB, paper files, etc.).</p><p>6.2 HOW DO EMPLOYEES REPORT A DATA BREACH?</p><p>In order for NCI to be able to comply with the GDPR, it is essential that all incidents (including suspected incidents) which give rise to the risk of unauthorised disclosure, loss, destruction or alteration of personal data are reported without delay to the DPO using the contact details found in section 2.2 of this document. Where the DPO is unavailable, a secondary point of contact shall be identified, and the incident shall be reported in line with the agreed procedure.</p><p>In the event of a suspected personal data breach happening, employees shall notify the DPO immediately. Employees shall not assume that the DPO is already aware of the suspected breach.</p><p>6.3 HOW DATA BREACHES WILL BE HANDLED IN NCI</p><p>The GDPR requires that NCI:</p><p>Document any personal data breaches, comprising the facts relating to the personal data breach, its effects and the remedial action taken. That documentation shall enable the supervisory authority to verify compliance</p><p>NCI has developed a separate, comprehensive Data Breach Incident Procedure in order to handle data breaches in line with the requirements of the GDPR. In the event of a suspected personal data breach, a summary of the personal data breach shall be recorded in the NCI Data Breach Log as per the procedure. Each summary shall contain the facts relating to the personal data breach, its effects, and the remedial action taken. The NCI Data Breach Log shall be maintained by the DPO. The DPO will assess the breach, and make a decision on the next steps to be taken.</p><p>Refer to the NCI Data Breach Incident Procedure for full procedures regarding:</p><p>Notifications to the supervisory authority</p><p>Notifications to data subjects</p><p>Notifications to controllers</p><p>All staff and contractors must familiarise themselves with the NCI Data Breach Incident Procedure.</p><p>7. THIRD COUNTRY TRANSFERS</p><p>All NCI personal data must remain within the European Economic Area (EEA). Where a business need requires the transfer or processing information outside of the EU, the NCI DPO shall be contacted for consultation.</p><p>Particular attention is required to the selection of processors when using online services, such as cloud services, for the processing of information as NCI must ensure all processing remains within the EU (e.g. online marketing surveys etc.).</p><p>8. DATA SHARING - CONTROLLER, PROCESSORS, AND THIRD PARTIES</p><p>8.1 WHAT IS OUR ROLE WITHIN NCI - DATA CONTROLLER OR PROCESSOR</p><p>The Article 29 Data Protection Working Party of the European Commission published a guidance document on the concepts of controller and processor (reference 3).</p><p>'Data controller' means:</p><p>the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which,</p><p>alone or jointly with others,</p><p>determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data;</p><p>The following provides 3 example scenarios within the NCI:</p><p>Scenario NCI  Third Party</p><p>Processing of Student Personal Data Controller Processor (FEI)</p><p>Processing of personal data for the provision of college accommodation (TCAS) Controller Controller</p><p>Processing of Student Personal Data Processor Controller (HEA)</p><p>In most instances, NCI has been identified as the Data Controller. Where there is uncertainty regarding the designation of NCI as either controller, processor, or joint controller, the DPO shall be consulted for clarification.</p><p>8.2 WHAT ARE OUR REQUIREMENTS IN THE USE OF DATA PROCESSORS AND HOW WE COMPLY WITH THEM?</p><p>Whenever NCI share personal data with a recipient outside of the Organisation, the sharing of the information must be governed by a contract that sets out the subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects, and the obligations and rights of the controller. This applies to all forms of sharing of information with recipients. For example, engaging the services of an external solicitor is no different to engaging the services of any other service provider. For that reason, it is unlawful for NCI to pass any personal data to an external solicitor unless NCI have put a contract in place describing the nature and purpose of processing, in addition to other specific contractual requirements as detailed in this section (the data protection principles and subject rights retained).</p><p>8.3 EVALUATION OF PROCESSORS AND PRE-PROCESSING AGREEMENTS</p><p>NCI must use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement, and be able to demonstrate, appropriate technical and organisational measures taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons.</p><p>Please see Addendum 1 for a list of standard questions which must be asked when engaging a processor, and prior to engagement of processor (used to help evaluate the suitability of the processor pre-contract). Processors must get permission to use further sub-processors – e.g. brokers.</p><p>8.4 WHAT ARE OUR REQUIREMENTS AS A DATA CONTROLLER AND HOW WE COMPLY WITH THEM?</p><p>All processing agreements must be governed by a contract that is binding on the processor with regard to the controller and that sets out:</p><p>subject matter</p><p>duration of the processing</p><p>nature and purpose of the processing</p><p>type of Personal Data and categories of data subjects</p><p>That contract or other legal act shall stipulate, in particular, that the processor:</p><p>Processes the personal data only on documented instructions from the controller, including with regard to transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law to which the processor is subject; in such a case, the processor shall inform the controller of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.</p><p>Processes all personal data within the EU.</p><p>Ensures that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.</p><p>Shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk including as appropriate:</p><p>the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data;</p><p>the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident;</p><p>a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing</p><p>the account shall be taken in particular of the risks that are presented by processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.</p><p>Assist NCI by appropriate technical and organisational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of the controller's obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data subject's rights under data protection requirements and good practice.</p><p>Assists NCI in ensuring compliance with the data protection obligations taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor.</p><p>At the choice of NCI, deletes or returns all the personal data to NCI after the end of the provision of services relating to processing, and deletes existing copies unless Union or Member State law requires storage of the personal data.</p><p>Makes available to NCI all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with our data protection obligations laid down in the GDPR and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by NCI or another auditor mandated by NCI.</p><p>The processor shall immediately inform the controller if, in its opinion, an instruction infringes any data protection regulations, acts or good practices.</p><p>Where a processor engages another processor for carrying out specific processing activities on behalf of NCI, the same data protection obligations as set out in the contract between NCI and the processor shall be imposed on that other processor by way of a contract, in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet NCI requirements. Where that other processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations, the initial processor shall remain fully liable to NCI for the performance of that other processor's obligations.</p><p>9. ADDENDUM 1: QUESTIONS FOR PROCESSORS</p><p>Please see below a list of standard questions which must be asked when engaging a processor, and prior to engagement of processor (used to help evaluate the suitability of the processor pre-contract).

ADDENDUM 2: PERSONAL DATA HANDLING RULES</p><p>In order to apply appropriate technical and organisational measures, it is necessary to classify and define handling rules for the different classifications of personal data.</p><p>10.1 PERSONAL DATA RISK LEVELS</p><p>At the heart of the GDPR, is an analysis of the risks from the various types of processing taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. This is based on the impact or level of damage that may be suffered by the Data Subject (as opposed to NCI).</p><p>A risk rating has been assigned to each Personal Data Category based on the following criteria:</p><p>Category Risk Level Description Information Examples</p><p>High This category contains personal data which includes Special Categories of personal data, personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences, bank account, or payment card number details.</p><p>Anything revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning medical or health, data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation.</p><p>Bank account or payment card details</p><p>Other information highly sensitive in nature, such as personal data relating to an individual’s criminal convictions and offences</p><p>Medium This category contains personal data which the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or unauthorised access to the data may result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.</p><p>Identification data such as social security numbers, copies of passports which may be able to identify ethnic origin, CCTV footage, etc.</p><p>Employee information including performance reviews, resumes, employee contracts or other non-Special Category data</p><p>Student information including course details, grades, assessments, and other non-Special Category data</p><p>Low This category contains personal data which the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or unauthorised access to the data is less likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.</p><p>All other forms of personal data including names, addresses, contact details etc.</p><p>10.2 DATA HANDLING RULES</p><p>The following defines the minimum handling requirements for each personal data classification. Note that all personal data (regardless of its format), may only be processed in line with data retention requirements:</p><p>Storage Item Low Medium High</p><p>Storage on Laptops Laptops not be used as a storage location</p><p>Storage on public or shared work drives (e.g. network file shares) May be stored in line with Data Retention requirements.  All personal data must be restricted on need to know basis. Must not be stored on public or shared work drives.</p><p>Storage on personal work drives (e.g. personal home folder) May be stored however should be structured in such a manner/system which ensures implementation of the Data Retention Policy.</p><p>Email transfer</p><p>Note: Email is a method of communication and must not be used as a storage location.</p><p>May be used for the transfer of information only. Email must not be considered as an area in which to store information for the long-term. Emails which are important must be saved into an appropriate storage area with other records on the same topic. This will ensure a full and complete record is kept and that emails containing personal data are not ‘lost’ or hard to retrieve should they be deleted or archived.</p><p>A contract must be in place for all recipients with whom personal data is shared, and the sharing should be appropriately risk assessed.</p><p>Consider encryption of email based on risk. Must be encrypted if transferred via email.</p><p>Processed within NCI structured applications (e.g. Microsoft CRM, Quercus+, etc.).</p><p>May be stored in line with Data Retention requirements, however, data stored must be minimised, and restricted on a “need-to-know” basis. Should not be stored unless deemed absolutely necessary and where appropriate technical and organisational controls are in place to protect the personal data.</p><p>Paper-based files – access control and transfers</p><p>A contract must be in place for all recipients with whom personal data is shared, and the sharing of the data must be appropriately risk assessed.</p><p>Must be restricted on a need to know and minimum rights basis.</p><p>Must not be stored in public/common areas.</p><p>Should not be stored or processed offsite except if there is an absolute business requirement and the risk appropriately assessed.</p><p>CCTV footage</p><p>Must not be disclosed unless:</p><p>A contract is in place</p><p>Legally required to disclose the footage (such as official investigation by Gardai where formal, written request has been made)</p><p>Must only be reviewed by authorised persons.</p><p>Must be processed on NCI controlled systems and within NCI physical location.</p><p>Must be securely destroyed in line with recommended data retention guidelines (current recommendation is 30 days).</p><p>Everything else</p><p>(Including spoken communications etc.)</p><p>Must not be disclosed unless a contract is in place.</p><p>Processed on NCI controlled systems and within NCI physical location.</p><p>Data Destruction</p><p>Must be securely destroyed in line with Data Retention requirements.</p><p>The above identifies minimum handling requirements only. Additional controls may be put in place for certain personal data types if required in addition to the above.</p><p>Data Protection Policy v6.pdf400 KB</p>"}

Its purpose is to support lecturers, programme developers, staff and management in ensuring that blended and online delivery is crafted and monitored in such a way that it provides the maximum benefit to the learner.</p><p>The term ‘Technology-Mediated Learning’ is primarily used to cover blended, hybrid and online learning, but in some cases may also refer to in-class learning that necessitates the use of technology as part of the delivery.</p><p>Table 1: Technology Mediated Learning Definitions</p><p>Blended Learning</p><p>Learners engage in a balanced mix of both online and face to face instructional events, which necessitate the design of on campus contact. Face to Face and Online Instructional events are exclusive</p><p>Online Learning</p><p>Learners engage primarily with online/remote instructional events not necessitating on campus contact</p><p>NCI’s strategy for technology-mediated learning is aligned with the College’s Learning, Teaching & Assessment Strategy. This document has been created in line with QQI’s 2018 Statutory Quality Assurance Guidelines for Providers of Blended Learning Programmes and has been adapted to address all Technology Mediated Learning delivery formats. The rationale for incorporating technology-mediated learning into the teaching, learning and assessment practices of the College includes:</p><p>Flexible and adaptive learning to suit students’ needs</p><p>Expanded collaboration and goal-oriented activities</p><p>Promoting self-directed and autonomous learners</p><p>Catering for individual learners through engagement and multiple modes of learning (e.g., visualization, animation, simulation, narrative and interactivity)</p><p>Supporting effective teaching strategies such as problem-based learning, meaningful contexts and case studies, learner collaboration, open and continuous assessments, simulations, learning by doing and many others.</p><p>Programmes that are delivered through synchronous learning events utilise the College’s Virtual Learning Environment (VLE[1]), and virtual classroom technology[2] platforms to present, organise and manage student learning activities.</p><p>Instructional settings detail the delivery method of a particular instructional event and are different from instructional pedagogy. Instructional settings to be used in the delivery of a technology-mediated programme may include a combination of one, many or all of the below, dependant on the instructional pedagogy of the programme:</p><p>Table 2: Definitions of Instructional Settings</p><p>a) Campus</p><p>The learning event (lecture, tutorial, laboratory or seminar) takes place on campus</p><p>b) Livestream</p><p>The learning event takes place on-line</p><p>c) Campus-livestream</p><p>The learning event takes place on campus and is simultaneously streamed on-line</p><p>d) CampusR</p><p>The learning event takes place on campus and a recording is available subsequently</p><p>e) LivestreamR</p><p>The learning event takes place on-line and a recording is available subsequently</p><p>f) Campus-livestreamR</p><p>The learning event takes place on campus and is simultaneously streamed on-line and a recording is available subsequently</p><p>g) Directed ELearning</p><p>Specified tasks to be carried out by students during a designated time interval</p><p>1.1      NCI’s Standards for Technology-Mediated Learning</p><p>Students on technology-mediated learning programmes are students of NCI and entitled to similar access to library, college supports, school and administrative structures.</p><p>Students are made aware of the technical specifications, time commitments and specifics of the delivery modes they will be engaging with before enrolling on the programme, via open days, course prospectus materials and via the website.</p><p>Students are advised in advance of commencement of the course of the technical requirements and pre-requisite skills for effective participation on the course.</p><p>Students are provided with support during course induction on how to use the learning technologies associated with the course.</p><p>NCI provides technical support for College systems (e.g. VLE, virtual class room, Student Portal etc.).</p><p>It is the responsibility of students to ensure they have the required local access and technical facilities if they are participating off-campus.</p><p>NCI can provide loan laptops to learners that require them, subject to criteria. Many programmes that are designed with Technology Mediated learning in mind are designed as Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) and will not be a part of the laptop loan scheme.</p><p>Programme and module learning outcomes and associated assessments are the same for all modes of delivery except where specifically specified and approved.</p><p>Lecturers are encouraged to apply good pedagogic design to their production and planning of student learning activities – this is achieved by mapping such activities against specific learning outcomes.</p><p>Support and ongoing professional development are provided to college staff in the design, production and use of new technologies in teaching and learning.</p><p>Students should be provided with opportunities to review archived instructional sequences for revision and assignment purposes. Where recording of instructional sequences is not appropriate, learners are provided with appropriate support material on the college’s LMS</p><p>Student assignments are submitted electronically through the LMS and Turnitin software unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Students are offered learning supports for their specific blend of Technology-Mediated Learning. This is designed in the programmatic review phase with the Digital Learning team.</p><p>Where a programme is validated and offered in a majority or fully online model i.e. fully or majority livestream, as per table 2 definitions, NCI will not set out to restrict learners’ geographic location/domicile, subject to evolving recruitment strategies and policies and QA requirements.</p><p>Where NCI wishes to offer a fully or majority online (programme to transnational learners, additional QA measures will be followed where necessary to ensure that the same high-quality standards are applied across the student lifecycle as are upheld for domestic learners – from initial application enquiry, through admission and registration, to learning and pastoral student support services, assessment, exams and graduation processes. These specific QA procedures will be contained in relevant Chapters of the NCI QA Handbook.</p><p>Where technology-mediated programmes have aspects of face to face or campus livestream learning, students are informed in advance of the in-person attendance expectations so that they can make an informed choice as to their entry on to the programme and their options for travel if necessary.</p><p></p><p>Where a programme’s assessment structure is in part or entirely online, the programme team will periodically review the assessment strategy to ensure that Academic Integrity challenges in an online learning environment are addressed and appropriately designed for, in line with Chapter 4 of the Quality Assurance Handbook as it relates to Academic Honesty and Academic Code.</p><p>1.2      Roles and Responsibilities</p><p>For each programme or module that is designed and delivered in a technology-mediated mode, accountable key roles have been identified.</p><p>Programme Director: Responsible for the academic management of the programme in accordance with policy in the Quality Assurance handbook (section 3)</p><p>Programme co-ordinator: Responsible for administrative support of the programme in accordance with the Quality Assurance handbook (section 3)</p><p>Content developer: Responsible for module content and working with the Digital Learning Design Team to ensure that the module is designed to be delivered using technology. The lecturer may fulfil the role of Content developer, but this is not necessarily the case in all circumstances. Content developers report directly to the School (management), which the programme is associated with.</p><p>Content editors: Responsible for editing content created by Content developers, to ensure suitable quality for online learners. Content editors are responsible for packaging digital learning content so that it is appropriate for use on the college’s LMS. Content editors report directly to the Digital Learning Design team.</p><p>Learning Experience Monitor: Responsible for guiding and monitoring the development and implementation of the Online Delivery for new modules or for lecturers who are new to technology-mediated delivery</p><p>Lecturer: Responsible for the delivery and assessment of the module as outlined in the approved programme document.</p><p>1.3      Digital Learning Design Team</p><p>The Digital Learning Design (DLD) Team consists of members of staff who are appropriately qualified and experienced in learning design and are required to, at a minimum, obtain a facilitator badge in Universal Design for Learning (UDL). The DLD team will ideally have postgraduate level awards in learning and teaching upon commencement in their role, and if not, are required to complete such an award.</p><p>During the programme development phase, the programme development team will be supported by the Digital Learning Design (DLD) team. The DLD team is responsible for ensuring that the programme team are supported in designing best practice pedagogy for Technology Mediated learning.</p><p>During the delivery phase, both the programme delivery team and the learners will be supported by the DLD, who will provide technical support on the learning tools used and will form an essential part of the module evaluation and review process.</p><p>The organisational chart below shows where the DLD team sits within the organisational structure.</p><p>Figure 1Organisational Structure</p><p>2       Validation of Technology-Mediated Learning Programmes</p><p>Technology-mediated programmes are subject to the programme development, validation, evaluation and review processes policies and procedures of the College. The initial validation of a programme should consider whether the full programme, or components thereof, can be delivered using technology mediated means.</p><p>Where a programme has already been validated by QQI and/or recognised by a professional body, the addition of this mode of delivery may require a differential validation as outlined in Quality Assurance procedures for programme validation.</p><p>Programmes developed with any aspects of technology-mediated learning must use the services of the Digital Learning Design team via the Center for Excellence in Lifelong Learning (CELL). The Digital Learning Design team will work with the programme team to ensure that NCI’s QA guidelines for Programmes using Technology-Mediated Learning are adhered to, and so that the programme team is sufficiently supported in resourcing and designing the program.</p><p>Programmes may not be delivered using Technology-Mediated Learning modes of delivery until approval to do so is received from the awarding body in line with its policies and procedures.</p><p>Proposals to develop new programmes using technology-mediated learning are subject to business case approval for viability and sustainability as outlined in NCI’s quality assurance procedures for programme development and validation. NCI’s QA procedures (2022/23) specify that all programmes which go through re/validation must do so via the Programme Lifecycle Management Executive Sub-Group which reports to the Executive and the Academic Council.</p><p>Any additional costs associated with development, review and evaluation must be considered. These include but are not limited to</p><p>Instructional design support</p><p>Assessment facilitation</p><p>Content updating</p><p>Recording facilities</p><p>Learner Supports</p><p>These must be thoroughly explored before proposing any programme using technology-mediated learning.</p><p>3       Learning & Teaching Strategies for Technology-Mediated Delivery</p><p>Lecturers will need to adapt their teaching style to promote engagement in technology mediated environments such as online classrooms, hybrid learning environments etc. To facilitate this, mandatory training will be provided to all lecturers who are new to a particular medium. This training is detailed in section 6 below. Training for all staff will also be ongoing throughout the year, and forums aimed at creating communities of practice for online education are set up on NCI’s systems. Peer review and collaboration is especially encouraged for lecturers engaged in technology mediated delivery, and the college’s Center for Excellence in Lifelong Learning will facilitate continuous professional development in key areas, such as Technology Enhanced Learning, and Universal Design for Learning.</p><p>NCI designs its training and learning and teaching strategies for technology mediated learning based on both QQI’s Statutory Quality Assurance Guidelines for Blended Learning, and the theoretical frameworks of Communities of Inquiry (COI) and Universal Design for Learning.</p><p>The COI framework allows NCI to remain focused on the Education experience by designing learning and teaching strategies that are focused on a learner’s social, cognitive and teaching presence. This in turn allows NCI to design courses that remain challenging and engaging in a technology mediated delivery.</p><p>Figure 2https://coi.athabascau.ca/coi-model/</p><p>The UDL framework is designed to improve and optimize teaching and learning for all people based on scientific insights into how humans learn. UDL is designed to support learners with different learning preferences, backgrounds and motivations, as well as learners with accessibility issues. UDL is especially important in technology mediated learning where access issues and engagement issues can be more prevalent. NCI encourages staff to engage with the UDL badge designed for the National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning by AHEAD and UCD Access & Lifelong Learning, and the Digital Learning Design Team specifically approaches programmatic design and review with UDL in mind.</p><p>4       Assessment in Technology-Mediated Programmes</p><p>All programmes are subject to the assessment policy and procedures of the College as set in Chapter 4 of the QA handbook. The assessment strategy, content and learning outcome mapping for a programme/module should be the same regardless of the instructional strategies of the module, however in some cases a different examination environment may be needed. As referenced in QQI’s review; ”e-Proctoring in Theory and Practice”, “the traditional assessment system through examinations might suit some disciplines (e.g., mathematics and related areas) but could not be considered optimal for all”. Whether online or face to face NCI strived to design assessment structures that have both validity and reliability, and which also promote assessment as a tool for learning, not simply of learning. In line with QQI’s document, NCI carefully selects tools for online assessment of any kind, be they LMS based or using an external proctoring system, following the guidance in the document. This document will be used as a reference point for any programme team who wish to design assessments that occur remotely.</p><p>In order to provide programmes with significant levels of remote/distance learning, it may be necessary to provide students with the option of taking their assessment in an online environment. In some cases this will not be appropriate e.g. in cases where professional body requirements necessitate in person exams. Where online assessment is used however, the environment must in turn be a straightforward, secure and student-centred offering which ensures not only the integrity of the exam process, but also does not advantage or disadvantage the student in any way over a traditionally proctored in-person equivalent.</p><p>These procedures are informed by the College’s policy and procedures on invigilation and ensuring the security and integrity of the assessment process as outlined in Section 4 of the QA handbook.</p><p>The following requirements have been identified as being necessary for the proctoring of online assessment.</p><p>4.1      Invigilation/Proctoring</p><p>Traditional face to face terminal assessments are proctored (invigilated).  It follows that online versions of these same examinations must also be proctored. This can happen via a live proctoring system, artificial intelligence driven systems, or via recordings which are subsequently reviewed.</p><p>4.2      Recording</p><p>To ensure the integrity of students’ exam environments, the following details must be captured.</p><p>Screen recording</p><p>Audio recording</p><p>Webcam recording</p><p>Each of these recordings must be complete, with no breaks in coverage for the duration of the exam.</p><p>4.3      Internet reliance</p><p>Students who engage in an online offering of a course generally do so from home. This means that it is unrealistic to always expect solid broadband connections. Therefore, any technical solution must not be reliant on a consistent internet connection at all times. This is not to say that the solution may not use the internet at all, rather that the reliance on a solid, uninterrupted connection is not viable. To this end, technical solutions which rely on consistent streaming may not be appropriate.</p><p>4.4      Data Capture</p><p>Reliance on data capture by an external organisation should be minimised where possible. Any external solution provider must be compliant with data protection laws, and organisations external to the EU must be Safe Harbour agreement compliant.</p><p>As with internal terminal examinations, student scripts must be kept for a year and a day. Where possible examinations should be delivered through NCI’s own Learning Management System and scripts should be captured through same.</p><p>4.5      Technical specifications</p><p>Any technical solutions must be able to run on all machines matching the minimum necessary technical specifications provided to students by the college on BYOD/Online courses.</p><p>4.6      Criteria for the Selection of Remote Proctoring Software & Provider</p><p>Any provider or software selected for the provision of remote proctoring services must fulfil the following criteria</p><p>The software must allow for complete lockdown of the learner’s device to services other than those permitted by the faculty member and/or programme team</p><p>The software must allow for the unambiguous identification of the student</p><p>The software has the capacity to capture a 360-degree overview of the testing environment</p><p>The process must make a copy of all recordings available at the end of the assessment</p><p>Reports from the process must be available within 3 days of the assessment</p><p>Proctors employed by the provider must be trained and evidence of that training provided</p><p>The provider used must have the capability to store recordings for at least 4 months</p><p>The provider must hold its data in a secure location within Europe or within a ‘safe-harbour’ environment</p><p>4.7      NCI’s Protocol for the Use of Remote Proctoring is contained in Appendix 1 to this document.</p><p>5       Admission and Registration of Learners to Technology-Mediated Programmes</p><p>The College’s admission and registration policies apply to all learners applying to and registered on technology-mediated learning programmes.</p><p>The College’s administrative systems accommodate:</p><p>online application,</p><p>online interview,</p><p>online registration, payment and curriculum selection processes.</p><p>online requests for extension of assessment deadlines, deferral of assessment, deferral of programme</p><p>online requests for application to financial assistance</p><p>Identification cards are posted to online learners. Learners on online or blended programmes are subject to NCI’s attendance and engagement policy. Engagement with online services will be monitored by the Education Engagement Officer.</p><p>Learner records, including records of their interactions in an online environment are subject to NCI’s record management, retention and data protection policies.</p><p>5.1      Access to Services and Learning Supports</p><p>The College’s policy on access to learning supports applies to all learners regardless of their mode of delivery. Learners are also given the option of availing of all supports and services face to face.</p><p>5.2      Supports Specific to Technology-Mediated Programmes</p><p>Programmes which are designed to be in online mediated format have supports that are specific to these mediums. The Digital Design Team (DLD) runs an online service aimed at helping learners who are not frequently on campus to navigate college life. This support service runs several interventions</p><p>The Learning Online Support Team (LOST) is a subset of the DLD, aimed at giving learners a human contact that remains with them throughout their college experience. The team is involved in orientation and open days and has a responsibility for visiting the learners throughout the semester in their classes. The LOST support team are available in the evenings for live chat/calls with learners who need pastoral support or guidance and runs a ticketed email and support account (lost@ncirl.ie) so that all student queries are responded to in a timely fashion.</p><p>LOST monitors learner interaction on Directed E-Learning courses, emailing learners that fall behind on a weekly basis with tips on catching up or seeking specific learning supports.</p><p>LOST runs support sessions throughout the semester aimed at helping learners adjust to technology mediated learning. These sessions are mainly study skills based.</p><p>LOST routinely liaises with class representatives to ensure that feedback related to technology mediated learning fed back to the relevant School/Lecturers and actioned.</p><p>NCI has in place specific contacts for bullying and harassment. Given the additional dangers of cyber bullying and harassment, a specific member of staff will be elected as the contact for cyber bullying and harassment.</p><p>5.3      Additional Supports</p><p>The College’s IT infrastructure uses virtual desktops which allows off-campus access to all IT services regardless of the mode of delivery of the programme</p><p>The Library & Information service provides significant online resources in the form of e-books and journal articles. A postal service is available to off-campus learners where required.</p><p>The Maths Support service has developed a significant number of online resources available to learners available via the Virtual Learning Environment</p><p>Learning Supports e.g. academic writing, disability support etc are provided using online delivery technologies</p><p>Computing Support is provided using online delivery technologies and has developed a significant number of online resources available to learners available via the Virtual Learning Environment</p><p>The Student Counselling and Wellness Service's aim is to support students and offer a supportive encouraging environment where students can talk about any struggles or difficulties they may be facing while they are in college. These services are available face to face or online.</p><p>6       Training and Support of Staff Developing, Delivering and Supporting Blended and Online Programmes</p><p>Both lecturing and support staff are provided with training in both the pedagogic and technical knowledge needed to provide an optimum level of support for students who are accessing those supports online.</p><p>Key support staff in the following departments will be required to train with the online classroom systems.</p><p>Computing support</p><p>Maths support</p><p>Learning support</p><p>Disability support</p><p>Learning Online Support</p><p>Any staff member asked to participate in online delivery is required to undertake training sessions aimed at improving online pedagogy and ensuring consistent and appropriate teaching methodologies, regardless of prior online delivery experience outside of NCI.</p><p>Staff will have the option of retraining each academic year.</p><p>6.1      Training for Synchronous Online Delivery</p><p>Training on the use of the virtual classroom platform is designed to address both the technical and the pedagogical competencies associated with teaching via technology mediated means. It addresses 5 key competencies</p><p>System training</p><p>Effective online delivery practices</p><p>Discussing motivation</p><p>Course design</p><p>Institutional support</p><p>Training takes place over 2 sessions which occur in advance of a facilitator/lecturer’s first delivery. Training then continues into the semester, as a Learning Experience Monitor will be assigned during the first 3 weeks of a delivery to provide support and feedback.</p><p>7       Learning resources, materials and delivery mechanisms are appropriate and fit-for-purpose</p><p>7.1      Modules/Part Modules for Synchronous Online Delivery (See Figure 1)</p><p>Learning events set for synchronous online delivery must be run through the module planning form (see figure 3 for example) and discussed with an instructional designer. This both allows the lecturer an opportunity to become cognisant of how their delivery may have to vary in an online mode, and allow for open and honest discussion and feedback about the planned delivery and assets with an online expert.</p><p>The initial delivery of each module will have a Learning Experience Monitor (LEM) assigned for the first 2-3 weeks of delivery. The LEM will be an individual trained in pedagogical approaches for online delivery who will assist lecturers in refining their technique and navigating the online system. They will also advise the IT department if there are any technical issues that require monitoring.</p><p>7.2      Modules/Part Modules to be Delivered Asynchronously</p><p>Content developed for asynchronous delivery is subject to the following process. See Figure 2.</p><p>Planning</p><p>A ‘Module Planning Form’ (MPF) is assigned to the Content Developer for the module. MPF’s ensure that the exact split of class contact vs asynchronous content is explicit throughout. Additionally, the exact makeup of the asynchronous content is made explicit, eg which elements are video based, reading based, audio etc, and the exact timings of these pieces</p><p>Before asynchronous content is created, the MPF must be signed off by both a member of the Digital Learning Design team, who will focus on the pedagogy of the content, and a subject matter expert from within the School who will assess the plan against the Learning Outcomes. It is expected that this process be an iterative and cyclical model which is fully completed before any content is developed.</p><p>Creation</p><p>Content Developers are assigned software licences to support the design and creation of video, audio and reading resources for learners. They are also given a set of guiding resources and principles to support their pedagogical design.</p><p>Content Developers are assigned a Content Editor, who will be able to edit video/audio and/or reading material so that it is formatted correctly for the college’s Learning management System.</p><p>Once material has been formatted it is sent back to the Content Creator for sign off.</p><p>Once signed off, the asynchronous materials are placed on the college’s learning management system by the Content Editors, who ensure that the material is visible to learners, and that it is created in such a way that the college can track learner engagement.</p><p>The choice of content to be delivered in this manner should be chosen carefully as the resources required to maintain and update this type of delivery are significant.</p><p>7.3      Modules/Part Modules to be Delivered via Campus-Livestream</p><p>Learning events that are delivered via campus livestream, eg an event on campus that is livestreamed using a virtual classroom system or similar. These events require careful planning and support and therefore can only be implemented where appropriate supports are available. Campus livestream events will be supported by NCI’s IT department who will provide a dedicated IT support service for these events. Programme development teams should be cognisant of the support need when timetabling events of this nature.</p><p>Lecturers/facilitators who deliver in this mode will undertake training designed specifically to support campus livestream and will be assigned a member of the Digital Learning Design team to act as a critical friend/peer for the duration of a module delivery.</p><p>7.4      Maintenance and Testing of Environments</p><p>The programme team will work closely with assigned contacts from the NCI I.T department and the Digital Learning Design team to ensure rigorous testing of both the online classroom systems and other technologies such as the virtual desktop environment are appropriately tested.</p><p>The I.T department is responsible for specifying a set of minimum technical requirements for students to have on their home machines. These specifications will be based on the technologies identified in the programmatic review/design process.</p><p>7.5      Learner Feedback</p><p>Programme teams are supported by the Quality and Institutional Effectiveness (QIE) team, as well as the Digital Learning Design team in the gathering, assessment and actioning of learner feedback. Programme teams are expected to regularly review feedback via the Annual Programme Evaluation and Review Process (APERS). The DLD team would support and guide programme teams to ensure the technology remains fit for purpose for maximising the quality of the experience. Qualitative and quantitative data would also be analysed within the quinquennial programme review process prior to programme revalidation through QQI, NCI’s Awarding Body.</p><p>It is important that learner feedback is taken seriously and is addressed in a timely fashion. This is especially true of feedback relating to technology mediated learning, as the technology itself can in some instances act as a barrier for learners causing them to become isolated. To this end, the Digital Learning Design team will engage with the class rep system to promote clear and open feedback loops between learners and the programme teams throughout the semester.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Figure 3: High Level Process for Synchronous Online Delivery</p><p>Figure 4: High Level Process for Asynchronous Online Delivery</p><p>Figure 5: Sample Module Planning Form – L8 Software Development</p><p>Please note that the above document is a sample document for review and may not reflect an accurate depiction of the module design. Please see explanatory statement below:</p><p>Week topic will be the ‘name’ of the topic/week as listed on Moodle.</p><p>Week intro message will be an introductory statement for learners that will give an overview of what to expect for that week of content.</p><p>The ‘Contact’ section is a broad teaching plan for the lecturer responsible for delivering the module. It will outline an example of how the synchronous contact time may be used. Lecturers are encouraged to use their own discretion and expertise here to better suit the classes needs and may diverge from the suggested lesson plan if they deem fit</p><p>The number beside both ‘Contact’ and ‘Directed’ refers to the expected time for a learner to engage with that aspect in minutes. 120 here suggests that a learner will spend 120 minutes in contact time this week, and 120 minutes engaging with directed materials.</p><p>The codes after each activity in the ‘Directed’ section denotes the type of activity and the learner effort required (in minutes). For instance, (V,10) denotes that the learners must watch a 10 minute video, and (TC,CC,15) denotes that a learner will be given templated code and a code challenge that will last approximately 15 minutes.</p><p>8       Appendix 1: Protocol for the use of remote proctoring</p><p>8.1      Purpose</p><p>To outline the process by which the invigilation of assessment undertaken under ‘examination’ conditions is managed in the following circumstances:</p><p>The module is delivered online</p><p>The learner is unable to attend an assessment for a validated reason and has been given permission by the Registrar to undertake the assessment in this manner</p><p>This applies to ‘in class tests’ and ‘terminal examinations’ and any time constrained assessment</p><p>8.2      Obligations of the School and Programme Team</p><p>The Programme Director/Vice-Dean must ensure that learners are afforded an opportunity to:</p><p>Test that their environment will facilitate access to the remote proctoring service</p><p>Take a dry-run assessment to understand how the process works at least 3 weeks before the assessment is scheduled.</p><p>8.3      Conditions to which a learner must agree in order to take a remotely proctored assessment:</p><p>The learner’s technical environment must meet the required specification as laid out in the programme information</p><p>Learners must permit the installation of the software used for this process on their device</p><p>Learners are required to establish identity following the procedures outlined by the software provider instructions.</p><p>Learners are responsible for self-testing the functionality of the system well in advance of all Remote Proctored exams in their courses, so that any troubleshooting that is required can be accomplished.</p><p>Learners must agree to the storing of their name, email address and a recording of the assessment on the software providers’ server/ This will be deleted at the end of the assessment period and after all appeals are completed.</p><p>The test environment must replicate the traditional environment and conform to the following:</p><p>A quiet, secure, fully lighted room for the examination</p><p>No other people in the room</p><p>Sit at a clean desk or clean table (not in a bed or sofa)</p><p>No talking out loud or communicating with others by any means (with the exception of contact with the faculty member in an emergency)</p><p>No leaving the room--this includes taking the computer.</p><p>The exam should be taken in the same room that the “Exam Environment View” is completed in/</p><p>There should be nothing except computer and external cameras/microphone on the desktop, tabletop or floor surrounding the learner</p><p>Bottles of water are allowed.

Context</p><p>As part of the National College of Ireland’s (NCI) Institutional Strategy, it has committed to ‘developing an active research and enterprise culture which supports the growth and development of Ireland’s knowledge economy’ (Key Goal 5).  In order to achieve this goal the College is fully committed to becoming a research active institution.  The College is aware of national objectives for research and wishes to play a full part in helping to achieve these while recognising the important role that research has to play in informing the teaching and learning strategy of the institution.</p><p>As a small institution with maturing research development, NCI has a number of strengths both in terms of its flexibility due to its relatively small number of staff and its ability to create true multi-disciplinary teams to address issues of academic and national interest.  Having stated this there are clear limitations inherent in our relative small size and limited research experience which require us to critically examine possible routes to expanding and extending our research capabilities.</p><p>It has long been recognised that it is neither desirable nor possible to have one single institute of higher education which excels in providing first class research across all disciplines.  Indeed policy initiatives and funding around research has emphasised the need for Irish institutions to work in a multi-disciplinary collaborative manner in order to achieve economies of scale.  The National College of Ireland, in developing its research strategy, is cognisant of this reality and while we have ambitious plans we recognise that these must be built upon sound foundations through working closely with both national and international partners.</p><p>The College is in a strong position to play an important research role in niche areas in which it has the expertise, experience and connectivity that can be leveraged to contribute to the challenges of the knowledge economy in Ireland.  Research enhances the College’s institutional standing, reputation and recognition as a third level educational institution.  It also provides an opportunity to maximise funding and develop a broader set of relationships, including collaborative partnerships with other educational institutions, industry and other organisations.  An active research environment not only enriches the College’s scholarly endeavours but is also critical to underpinning the development of a thoughtful and robust Teaching & Learning Strategy which is in addition closely aligned to the Knowledge Transfer aspirations of the College.  The College aims to ensure that there is a clear link between what we teach and what we research and that the new knowledge created is accessible to all interested stakeholders.</p><p>Research at National College of Ireland is regarded as a core activity which is embedded in the academic culture and which contributes to the overall mission of the College.  The vision for research at the National College of Ireland is one which sees it as contributing to the realisation of Ireland’s full potential as a knowledge-based economy. The delivery on this vision is through the development of a number of research active clusters.  In doing so the Research Strategy is directly linked to and informs the Teaching and Learning and the Knowledge Transfer Strategies.  The College is also committed to ensuring that learners from a diversity of backgrounds have access to education, at all levels including postgraduate research opportunities.  The new Institutional Strategy continues this commitment.</p><p>11.1.1   Process of Research Strategy Formulation</p><p>The institutional Research Strategy is developed by the Research Committee. A Research Committee was convened in 2007 with the purpose of reviewing the Institutional Strategy and identifying potential strategic opportunities for the development of an integrated strategic College wide Research Strategy.  The Research Committee is comprised of representatives from each of the Schools, administrative staff, enterprise staff and is chaired by the VP Academic Affairs Research or nominee.</p><p>The Research Strategy is informed by the institutional strategy and by developments in the broader national and international education, research and knowledge transfer strategy space.</p><p>11.1.2   NCI Research Strategy (2007 – 2014)</p><p>The College’s overall strategic objective in terms of its research strategy is ‘o develop an internationally recognized research active college with a reputation for applied research’. Please Note: The Research strategy is currently in re-development as of October 2018.</p><p>In order to achieve this objective it requires us to:</p><p>Support creative enquiry to allow it to flourish through engagement in scholarly research, which is integrally linked with scholarship in learning and teaching (Linked to Institutional Strategic Goal 2).</p><p>Support the aims and values of the National College of Ireland through scholarly research that address lifelong learning, access and social justice (Linked to Institutional Strategic Goals 1-5);</p><p>Contribute to and inform the broader discourse on lifelong learning and skills development in the context of` EU and national policies (Linked to Institutional Strategic Goals 1, 4).</p><p>Increase the quality and quantity of research outputs (Linked to Institutional Strategic Goals 1-5).</p><p>Provide excellence in research-based graduate education by delivering specialised courses relevant to the needs of a knowledge society (Linked to Institutional Strategic Goal 3).</p><p>Establish and nurture strategic alliances and partnerships with other third level institutional partners (Linked to Institutional Strategic Goal 5).</p><p>Develop and apply new models of access to learning in the workplace, classroom and community (Linked to Institutional Strategic Goal 1).</p><p>Provide students at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels with access to scholars and researchers who actively contribute to extending the boundaries of knowledge and understanding (Linked to Institutional Strategic Goal 2)</p><p>The eight strategic research objectives outlined above are highly ambitious however they are realistic and critical to the continued growth and success of the National College of Ireland.  In order to achieve these objectives a number of linked strategic actions are required which the College is fully committed to.</p><p>11.1.3   Research by Faculty</p><p>NCI is committed to attracting, developing and retaining staff who are active researchers in their respective discipline(s). Accordingly, the College aims to provide all faculty with core research skills training to enable them to participate fully in the research agenda of the College. We will encourage innovative research projects that attract high quality graduate learners and visiting scholars.  In addition, the College has sought to recruit faculty with strong research profiles while also encouraging and supporting existing staff to undertake PhD’s where appropriate.</p><p>11.1.4    Promoting Research Excellence</p><p>NCI is committed to promoting research excellence across all disciplines and amongst all faculty by recognizing, supporting and rewarding those members of faculty who make significant contributions towards the College’s research agenda.  We will provide faculty with greater professional fulfilment and balance between teaching and research and have initiated a number of schemes to support this aim namely; a new work load model, a seed fund for research, a fellowship scheme for excellence in teaching & learning.  As part of this process the College will ensure that the enabling conditions and structures are in place to support researchers in the College.</p><p>11.1.5    Developing Research Clusters.</p><p>The College will focus its research on a small number of areas (or themes), given the limited resources and the need to play to existing strengths.  Initial research will focus on;</p><p>Learning and TeachingInnovation: including the use of technology to enhance learning, skills acquisition, literacies and learning in organisational, community and classroom contexts. This research cluster will also focus on the area of philosophy of social science specifically the interpretation of the philosophy to inform the teaching and research agenda of the College.  The College will form strategic partnerships with other educational institutions, business and industry to enable this inquiry.</p><p>Economic & Social Development: including macro and micro economics, finance and financial markets, enterprise, regional development and urban regeneration, social development and inclusion, social justice and ethics, social corporate responsibility and the advancement of women. The College will seek to ensure that the three Schools work in a collaborative manner with external partners to enable this inquiry.</p><p>Marketing & International Business: including strategy, growth, consumer studies, marketing communication and competencies, technology advancement in the area of business and international trade and markets.</p><p>Organisational Growth & Sustainability: including employment and working conditions, work life balance, industrial relations and partnership and effective management of change in public and private sector organisations.</p><p>Psychology</p><p>Developing Structured Graduate Research Programmes. NCI is aware of national policy with regard to research and regards the development of robust structured graduate research programmes as a pivotal support to achieving a knowledge based, ‘Smart’ economy.  The College will actively seek to collaborate with other HEI’s to develop a suite of programmes.</p><p>Building strategic collaborative partnerships. NCI will develop research partnerships with commercial and government organisations through the development of common research projects.  We will also focus on investigating and establishing strategic collaborative partnerships through both national and international collaborations with other academic institutions that are undertaking similar research.</p><p>Promoting Knowledge Transfer through linking Teaching and Learning. The Knowledge Transfer and the Teaching and Learning Strategies are inextricably linked to the Research Strategy of the College. NCI will promote and embed a culture of knowledge transfer of research through teaching and learning to enhance the experience of students of the College and those who teach them.  In addition we will seek out opportunities to extend policy, public and commercial awareness of NCI through access to our research, results and discussions as clearly articulated in the Knowledge Transfer Strategy document.</p><p>11.2.      Quality Assurance System for research</p><p>NCI aspires toward excellent standards of quality in all aspects of its research work.  In order to promote such excellence of quality in its research activities, management of research activities are central to the work of the Schools and can be supported by the Research Office depending on resources. For this reason, All research projects will be expected to have strong academic support. Only projects for which the College has adequate resources will be undertaken.</p><p>11.1.5.1  Postgraduate Research</p><p>In accordance with the memorandum of agreement between NCI and Maynooth University, postgraduate research programmes are subject to the procedures of Maynooth University.</p><p>All proposals of postgraduate research must have also have the approval of the Research Committee and the Academic Council.

Appendix 1: NCI Intellectual Property Policy</p><p>11.1.22                Introduction</p><p>As part of the National College of Ireland’s Institutional Strategy, it has committed to ‘developing an active research and enterprise culture which supports the growth and development of Ireland’s knowledge economy’. The College is aware of national objectives for research and wishes to play a full part in helping to achieve these while recognising the important role that research has to play in informing the teaching and learning strategy of the institution.</p><p>Appendix 11 describes a summary of the IP principles as approved by the NCI executive board in conjunction with solicitors at Gallen Alliance.</p><p>As a small institution at the early stages of research development, NCI has a number of strengths both in terms of its flexibility due to its relatively small number of staff and its ability to create true multi-disciplinary teams to address issues of academic and national interest.</p><p>Research at National College of Ireland is regarded as a core activity which is embedded in the academic culture and which contributes to the overall mission of the College. The vision for research at the National College of Ireland is one which sees it as contributing to the realisation of Ireland’s full potential as a knowledge-based economy. The delivery on this vision is through the development of a number of research active clusters. In doing so the Research Strategy is directly linked to and informs the Teaching and Learning and the Knowledge Transfer Strategies. The College is also committed to ensuring that learners from a diversity of backgrounds have access to education, at all levels including postgraduate research opportunities. The new Institutional Strategy reflects this commitment.</p><p>This document contains the updated policy and procedures relating to NCI’s intellectual property. In accordance with accepted International Best Practice, it sets out the policy and rules that govern the creation, ownership and commercialisation of intellectual property developed by NCI staff, students and others participating in educational programmes carried out for NCI or undertaken using NCI facilities, know-how, confidential information or intellectual property. This policy does not apply to companies that use NCI facilities on a commercial basis for example a company that uses the usability lab using Enterprise Ireland innovation vouchers is exempt from this policy.  The Policy is intended to actively support the commercialisation of Intellectual Property in a manner which ensures maximum benefit to society and the Irish economy, while providing significant financial reward and recognition for the creator of the intellectual property, NCI and where appropriate, the sponsor of the research.</p><p>NCI encourages the commercialisation of Intellectual Property through a support programme and a share of the resulting income to the creators of such intellectual property.</p><p>This document builds on the National College of Irelands Research and Knowledge Transfer Strategy and the Intellectual Policy as described in the National College of Irelands Research Strategy, 2007-2014. In addition this document strives to take account of the changes in legislation including the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000 and related policies such as National Codes of Practice and the Funding Agency guidelines for management and commercialisation of intellectual property (Annex VI) as follows:</p><p>Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (ICSTI) National Code of Practice for Managing Intellectual Property Arising from Publicly Funded Research, published in 2004.</p><p>Advisory Science Council National Code of Practice for Managing and Commercialising</p><p>Intellectual Property Arising from Public-Private Collaborative Research, published in 2005.</p><p>Funding Agency Requirements and Guidelines for Managing Research-Generated Intellectual Property, February 2006.</p><p>11.1.23                Definitions</p><p>For the purposes of this document the following definitions apply</p><p>Intellectual Property Advisory Committee represents a sub-committee of the Research Committee.</p><p>11.1.24                Scope of Policy</p><p>The policy is applicable to NCI intellectual property that is owned by the college. The policy is applicable to NCI intellectual property that is created by NCI personnel. The policy is applicable to all schools, centres, and institutes affiliated to NCI.</p><p>Visiting lecturers, students and other personnel at NCI who have a prior existing and conflicting intellectual property arrangement with another employer or third party must enter into an agreement with the college (and their employer or relevant third party) (Appendix 3) to abide by the conditions of the policy in the course of their activities in NCI.</p><p>The college also welcomes the opportunity to consider for inclusion under this Intellectual Property Support Programme intellectual property which does not come under the definition of NCI intellectual property. In such cases the ownership of the intellectual property must be assigned to NCI.</p><p>11.1.25                Definition and Ownership</p><p>The Irish statutory provisions governing the ownership of intellectual property rights are described in Appendix 1.</p><p>As a general rule (and subject to the exceptions set out in the Policy) the rights to NCI Intellectual Property is the property of and vests solely and absolutely in NCI.

These personnel are collectively referred to as NCI personnel in this document. NCI Intellectual Property includes rights in any material, including any copyright (including rights in computer software and moral rights but subject to the exception set out below), patent, design right, trademark rights, brand rights, database rights, know how, trade secrets, confidential information, rights in design, or other intellectual property rights or other property rights, whether vested, contingent or future anywhere in the world. (A full definition of intellectual property is contained in Appendix 2). The Policy applies particularly but not exclusively to any intellectual property rights in materials and/or inventions which are created in whole or in part or caused to come into existence by NIC personnel:</p><p>While undertaking normal or specifically assigned duties either when intellectual property could be reasonably expected to result from the carrying out of those duties and/or, at the time the intellectual property was developed, there was a special obligation on the creator of the intellectual property to further NCI’s interest;</p><p>When using NCI’s equipment, supplies, facilities or NCI’s Assets.</p><p>Using NCI’s confidential information, trade secrets, know how or any of the intellectual property of NCI; or</p><p>In relation to any work performed for NCI (including pursuant to any third party funded research programmes).</p><p>Under the terms of the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000 NCI owns all copyright in works created by its employees in the course of their employment. In recognition of the unique position of NCI and in accordance with long-standing academic tradition, NCI does not and will not assert ownership of copyright in pedagogical works, scholarly publications, books or artistic works of its employees, regardless of the form of expression, unless there is a written agreement to the contrary.</p><p>This exception to NCI ownership of intellectual property does not extend to copyright in software or to database rights. NCI will not assign rights to the usage of teaching materials to any third party without the prior agreement of the author/creator. If there is an opportunity to exploit those materials/works with a party independent of NCI, then the commercial value of that exploitation will be shared between NCI and the author/creator in accordance with the policy on shared royalties.</p><p>11.1.26                Aims of Intellectual Property Policy and Procedures</p><p>The aim of the IP Policy and procedures are:</p><p>To create an environment that supports and encourages staff, faculty and students to generate new knowledge and commercialise their research.</p><p>To encourage the recognition and identification of IP within NCI and promote an entrepreneurial culture among its staff and students.</p><p>To maximise the commercialisation of intellectual property arising from NCI research for the benefit of the economy and society.</p><p>To encourage public use and commercialisation of NCI’s Intellectual Property by facilitating its transfer from NCI to industry and business.</p><p>To establish principles and procedures for the protection and commercialisation of NCI Intellectual Property and for sharing of royalty and other income.</p><p>To provide genuine incentives/rewards and recognition for creators of intellectual property.</p><p>To foster the general awareness of staff of this policy through dissemination and information campaigns, and to provide specific training to research active staff.</p><p>To provide an incentive for NCI personnel and students to become involved in technology transfer.</p><p>11.1.27                Support Programme</p><p>11.1.27.1          Director of Research</p><p>The Director of Research in NCI will be responsible for supporting the development and commercialisation of NCI Intellectual Property.  All NCI Intellectual Property including inventions, software and other intellectual property that has commercial potential must be disclosed by NCI personnel on a timely basis to the College through the Director of Research. This function will be supported by the Intellectual Property Advisory Committee. The Director of Research is in charge of the administration of the activities set out in this IP Policy. The Director of Research shall:</p><p>Be responsible for the day-to-day management of the IP Policy.</p><p>Process IP applications.</p><p>Have authority to externally communicate on matters of IP on behalf of NCI; and</p><p>Manage internal communications regarding IP within NCI.</p><p>Raise awareness of policy among researchers and staff</p><p>Provide support to researchers on the NCI IP Policy and processes.</p><p>11.1.27.2          The Intellectual Property Advisory Committee</p><p>The intellectual property advisory committee shall be a sub-committee of the Research committee and shall consist of the following members:</p><p>Director of Research/Chair of the Research Committee</p><p>School of Business representative</p><p>School of Computing representative</p><p>Commercial Manager</p><p>The IPA Committee members will be required to sign a confidentiality agreement regarding proposals submitted and regarding the IP produced at NCI and passed to the Committee. This will ensure that new ideas are protected. NCI reserves the right to alter the composition of this Committee.</p><p>The relevant NCI academic supervisor/project manager may be required to put forward a proposal to the IPA Committee regarding the IP on a project and may be requested to attend a Committee meeting, were appropriate.</p><p>Members of the IPA Committee will be required to declare their interest in a proposal if such exists and to absent themselves from any discussion pertaining thereto.</p><p>The commercial manager will be responsible for liaising with the technology transfer office to fulfil the duties of the technology transfer office in relation to each of the activities set out in this IP Policy including (without limitation) putting the decisions of the IPA Committee into effect.</p><p>11.1.27.3          Role of the IPA Committee</p><p>Members of the IPA Committee will be involved in:</p><p>Identification of intellectual property and evaluation of commercial potential.</p><p>Appoint experts to review the IP.</p><p>Determining IP agreements with industry regarding collaborative research projects.</p><p>Facilitating a fair and equitable return to those involved in commercialisation of their research/work.</p><p>Nominating negotiators with third parties and ensuring a reasonable financial return to the personnel involved (where appropriate) and to NCI.</p><p>Protection of intellectual property including processing of patent, registered design and trade mark applications with the assistance of patent attorneys and other professionals where appropriate.</p><p>The formulation and implementation of strategies for commercialisation in a timely manner and in partnership with the inventor(s).</p><p>Negotiating assignments and licences, options for licences or other commercial arrangements with third parties to assist in producing a financial return to the creators of the intellectual property and NCI. In this regard, consideration will be given to the need for NCI to retain access to know-how and research material for on-going research purposes.</p><p>Assist in the marketing and business support of NCI Intellectual Property for commercialisation.</p><p>11.1.27.4          Role of the Commercial Manager and the Technology Transfer Office</p><p>The technology transfer office shall be outsourced and as such the commercial manager will be responsible for managing the relationship with the technology transfer office.</p><p>The Commercial Manager and the Technology Transfer Office is in charge of putting the decisions of the IPA Committee into effect. The Commercial Manager and  the Technology Transfer Office shall:</p><p>Provide information to researchers on potential funding avenues and appropriate business development programmes.</p><p>Provide information on incubation facilities, advice and support for establishment and development of campus companies.</p><p>Subject always to the IPA Committee to which the Commercial Manager and the Technology Transfer Office will report as reasonably required by the IPA Committee and to which it will remain accountable.</p><p>11.1.28                General Provisions of NCI IP Policy</p><p>As a general rule subject to the exceptions set out in this IP Policy, any IP rights in or to any material/works created by Personnel in the course of their employment or education by NCI or in relation to work carried out for NCI is the property of and vests solely and absolutely in NCI or such companies or organisations as NCI may nominate for such purposes. Such material/works include, but are not limited to any:</p><p>Copyright (including rights in computer software and moral rights);</p><p>Patents;</p><p>Design rights;</p><p>Trademark rights;</p><p>Brand rights;</p><p>Database rights;</p><p>Know how;</p><p>Trade secrets;</p><p>Confidential information rights in design;</p><p>Or other intellectual property rights or other property rights, (whether vested, contingent or future anywhere in the world).</p><p>This applies to any IP developed by personnel which they cause to come into existence:</p><p>During their time in NCI or if related to the College personnel’s job responsibilities, even if he or she is not specifically requested to create it;</p><p>When using NCI’s equipment, supplies, facilities or NCI Assets;</p><p>During an individual’s use of their personal time or own facilities if the basic nature of the work created is related to the individual’s job;</p><p>Using NCI’s confidential information, trade secrets, know how or any NCI IP; or</p><p>In relation to any work performed for NCI (including pursuant to any third party funded research programmes).</p><p>At NCI's reasonable cost, Personnel also agree at any later time to execute any documentation or otherwise provide assistance to NCI to secure, protect, perfect or enforce any of NCI’s rights, title and interests in and to NCI IP.</p><p>This IP Policy is applicable to IP that is owned by NCI, for (without limitation) any of the reasons outlined below:</p><p>It is developed by personnel in the course of their normal or specifically assigned duties either when IP could reasonably be expected to result from the carrying out of those duties and/or, at the time the IP was developed, there was a special obligation on the relevant personnel to further the interest of NCI.</p><p>Under the 2000 Act (as defined in Appendix 1 of this IP Policy), NCI is the first owner of any copyright in the work created by staff in the course of their employment unless precluded by a prior agreement between NCI and a third party (or as covered by section 11.1.28 of this IP Policy).</p><p>The IP arises out of funded or non-funded research where such research has, in the opinion of NCI, made use of the equipment, facilities, NCI Assets and/or other resources of NCI (except where ownership of such IP was provided for in a prior agreement between NCI and third parties).</p><p>If it is a condition of the appointment of a student to perform research, that NCI should have ownership of the IP arising from the research performed by such student.</p><p>If it is a condition of the appointment of another Relevant Party to perform research that NCI should have ownership of the IP arising from the research performed by such Other Relevant Party.</p><p>IP arising from research or other work sponsored by an external organisation shall be subject to the IP provisions that are stipulated in the related agreement between NCI and the external organisation. Where such an  agreement requires all new IP rights to be assigned to a private company, the entry level (or “background”) NCI IP should be defined so that it is not inadvertently assigned to the private company as part of the new IP (also described as “foreground IP” or “results”) but is retained as NCI IP. All such research agreements should be reviewed by a legal person representing NCI.</p><p>For the avoidance of doubt, where IP is generated from research that is 100% funded by monies provided directly by the State, or by any not-for-profit financial instrument which has been established by an organisation or individual, and awarded through a public service organisation charged with the granting and dissemination of research funds, this IP will be exclusively and absolutely owned by NCI and subject to the terms of the granting body.</p><p>The IP Policy also extends to Other Relevant Parties such as non-employees who participate in research projects at the college including visiting academics, industrial personnel etc. unless a specific waiver has been approved. Other Relevant Parties at NCI who have a prior existing and conflicting intellectual property agreement or arrangement with another employer or third party must enter into an agreement with NCI (and their employer or relevant third party) (see Appendix 10) to abide by the conditions of this IP Policy in the course of their activities in NCI. Other Relevant Parties should contact the IPA Committee to clarify any existing IP arrangements.</p><p>For the avoidance of doubt, NCI, in its sole discretion, may assign to inventor(s), by written instrument only, any IP owned by NCI, which NCI has determined not to be of commercial interest to it. Further, it is understood if NCI does not find a means of exploiting such IP within a three (3) year period after filing, then NCI has the right, but not the obligation, to assign ownership rights to the inventor(s). Requests for assignment to the inventor should be made to the Director of Research.</p><p>In order to enable the achievement of the aims and goals of this IP Policy, the IPA Committee will, through dissemination of information and the holding of general information sessions for personnel, foster the general awareness of personnel of this policy. In addition, the IPA Committee will provide specific training on this IP Policy and its day to day application and relevance to research active personnel.</p><p>11.1.29                Consultancy</p><p>Staff are permitted to engage in consultancy projects for third parties subject to compliance with NCI’s Consultancy Policy and their contract of employment and subject to written approval by the President of NCI. Any such approved consultancies must be disclosed to the IPA Committee. This NCI Consultancy Policy is currently under development.</p><p>11.1.30                Intellectual Property Assignments and Patent Assignments</p><p>Intellectual property assignments and patent assignments apply to all the Colleges, Schools, Centres, Institutes, academic, research and other College staff (full time or part time), students, college consultants or any third party conducting research or other intellectual activity using NCI’s supplies, facilities, NCI Assets, confidential information, trade secrets or existing intellectual property of NCI. This clause may continue after the individual ceases to be an NCI employee, student or consultant.</p><p>As a condition of employment as a college employee and as a condition of admission of every student, each staff member or student (as the case may be) shall comply with the Intellectual Property Policy and shall agree to assign to NCI (or a person or company designated by the College or an agency which provided the funding for the relevant research) any and all Intellectual Property created and produced or otherwise developed while the person was an employee or a student of the College.</p><p>When required by the specific circumstances of a project and on the request of the IPA Committee, a member of personnel will agree:</p><p>To sign an Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement (see Appendix 8);</p><p>To execute such documents of assignment or other documentation required to assign or transfer IP and any moral rights to ensure, protect, perfect and enforce NCI’s rights, title and interest in NCI IP;</p><p>To do anything that may reasonably be required to assist any assignee of any patent application or other IP to obtain, protect and maintain its rights, title and interest; and</p><p>Shall use all reasonable endeavours to do or procure to be done all such further acts and things and to execute or procure the execution of all such other documents as may be reasonably required from time to time for the purpose of giving each party hereto the full benefit of the provisions of this IP Policy.</p><p>11.1.31                Research Financed by Third Parties</p><p>Any research which is partly or wholly financed by any third party agency shall be subject to the specific provisions of the grant or contract covering that research. In the event of any inconsistency between this IP Policy and the terms of any such grant or contract the provisions of the said grant or contract shall prevail provided that the IP clauses in such grant or contract have been reviewed by the Technology Transfer Officer (who may seek external advice if necessary) and, in the case of a contract, such contract has been properly executed by NCI.</p><p>11.1.32                 Administration of the IP Policy</p><p>At NCI, the Director of Research will be responsible for supporting the development and commercialisation of NCI IP and this will be supported by the Technology Transfer Officer.</p><p>The Technology Transfer Officer will ensure that appropriate IP education and training is carried out with respect to staff and students, in particular final year undergraduate students (and as required other relevant personnel) of NCI.</p><p>11.1.33                 Disclosure and Evaluation</p><p>It is a condition of employment or engagement by NCI as staff; admission by NCI as a student; or engagement by NCI as an Other Relevant Party such as a collaborating research partner; that the results of all research or projects should be fully, promptly and completely disclosed to NCI.</p><p>All researchers, staff and students must disclose any IP arising from such research to NCI through the IPA Committee in the form of an Invention Disclosure Form (IDF) as soon as possible after such IP is apparent. The IPA Committee should assess it and get professional advice etc. in a timely manner.</p><p>No publication should be made prior to disclosure. However, it is possible to commercialise and publish providing there is no damaging disclosure and the disclosure schedule is agreed. In the context of a collaborative research, a partner who wishes to publish results must first obtain permission from the other partner(s).</p><p>Confidentiality agreements and/or non-disclosure agreements should be used where appropriate.</p><p>11.1.33.1          Procedures to Protect IP</p><p>Staff member or student (with supervisor) contacts the IPA Committee</p><p>They will inform IPA Committee of their intention to complete an Invention Disclosure Form (see Appendix 5). The IPA Committee may consult with commercialisation experts regarding the completion of the Invention Disclosure Form.</p><p>Submission of Invention Disclosure Form:</p><p>This form should be promptly submitted (and in any event no later than within 30 days of the discovery or invention of the discovery or invention in question) to the IPA Committee.</p><p>Commercial Evaluation of IP:</p><p>Any IP reported in an Invention Disclosure Form shall be submitted to the IPA Committee for assessment under the guidelines of the IP Policy and for recommendations to NCI regarding the patentability and/or potential commercialisation.</p><p>The IPA Committee may recommend that other suitably qualified advisors or external consultants be engaged to advise on the assessment of the IP.</p><p>As far as practicable, the relevant inventors or researchers should be involved in the evaluation (and where relevant protection) process by the IPA Committee.</p><p>The criteria to assess the commercial value of the IP should include (without limitation):</p><p>A literature review to establish if the idea is innovative.</p><p>Assessment that the IP has a potential commercial benefit.</p><p>Technical and commercial feasibility.</p><p>Proof of concept (business plan, access to finance etc.).</p><p>Potential for sale or licensing of technology or consultancy.</p><p>Demonstrates a competitive advantage based on differentiated or innovative product or service.</p><p>Development stage of the subject matter.</p><p>Commercial focus and profit motive.</p><p>Study of comparable existing subject matter, licences and commercialisation practices.</p><p>Proximity to market.</p><p>Market valuations</p><p>Barriers to entry into markets.</p><p>Estimated projected sales based on market research.</p><p>Third party assistance including for example input from industry and state agencies.</p><p>Estimated cost of patent process.</p><p>Whilst the criteria listed above are not exhaustive, it provides guidance to persons submitting an application as well as to those determining the commercial value. As it is a complex decision, the IPA Committee may refer to other expertise (internal or external) where necessary and further criteria may be applied.</p><p>A decision will be made by the IPA Committee and the originator of the IP will be notified in writing of the decision made.</p><p>Should the Committee decide to pursue the project; the staff member will be required to complete an IP Assignment Form (see Appendix 8).</p><p>The IPA Committee may decide in appropriate circumstances, to offer the opportunity to the originator of the IP to pursue exploitation independently if this is deemed appropriate under agreed written terms. NCI will have no rights to commercial revenue resulting from IP, if it subsequently proves successful, subject to any agreed terms.</p><p>Submission of a patent application or an application for other protection:</p><p>NCI shall have the right, but not the obligation, either directly or through an outside agent, to seek patent or other protection of the IP and to undertake efforts to introduce the invention into public use.</p><p>Where a decision is made by the IPA Committee to proceed with an application for protection of the IP, the process below shall be carried out in a timely manner.</p><p>Where a decision is made by the IPA Committee to proceed with a patent application, the originator of the IP is required to cooperate in every reasonable way, to execute all necessary documents and to assist the IPA Committee in completing the patent application form. The application should remain confidential until such time as the process is complete. Confidentiality agreements will be used where appropriate.</p><p>Commercialisation activities should recognise specific terms and conditions in appropriate funding contracts including any Collaborative Research Agreements.</p><p>The cost of the submission of the application shall be paid by NCI. The originator may be required to assist NCI and/or its advisors with the preparation of a claim for appropriate support for IP protection. Any expenses incurred will be reimbursed to NCI prior to the distribution of any royalty or other income (if any) from the IP.</p><p>The originator of the IP and NCI shall take all reasonable precautions to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the IP in question. The originator of the IP should be aware that publication prior to the filing of patent applications may prevent the granting of certain patents.</p><p>NCI may decide at any stage to withdraw from the process of exploiting a particular piece of IP. This may arise where:</p><p>Concern exists regarding the technical or commercial feasibility of a particular piece of IP,</p><p>Costs of exploiting the IP are excessive, or</p><p>External sponsorship of the process is no longer available.</p><p>The originator of the IP will be notified in writing of the intention of NCI to withdraw from the process and the withdrawal will apply from immediate effect.</p><p>Where a decision is not made about the commercialisation of the IP within the determination period or where it is determined that NCI does not wish to commercialise the IP, the IP may, at NCI’s entire discretion, be assigned or licensed to the originator, offering the opportunity to the originator of the IP to pursue exploitation independently.</p><p>No patent application, assignment, licensing or other agreement may be entered into or will be considered valid with respect to NCI IP except when properly and lawfully executed by NCI.</p><p>11.1.34                 Commercialisation</p><p>The IPA Committee will assist, provide advice, or procure the provision of outside professional advice in relation to the various options for commercialisation and technology transfer that may be appropriate in order to best meet the aims of this IP Policy, including:</p><p>Licensing the IP to a third party for a fixed sum or a royalty related to future sales.</p><p>Assigning the IP to a third party for a fixed sum or a royalty related to future sales.</p><p>Developing the commercial potential of the IP through a campus company.</p><p>Developing the commercial potential of the IP through a joint venture with a third party.</p><p>Any other arrangement that may be considered appropriate.</p><p>A separate NCI Campus Company Policy outlines NCI’s position on spin-off companies and the division of income from such enterprises. This NCI Campus Company Policy is under development.</p><p>In providing this advice and assistance, the IPA Committee will give due consideration to the retention of the right to use and access know-how and research materials for the purpose of continuing and further research as well as options which may provide most benefit to the Irish economy.</p><p>11.1.35                 Distribution of Commercialisation Income</p><p>The College shall share a proportion of net royalty and other net income generated by the college from the commercialisation of NCI Intellectual Property with the approved creators or authors of the said intellectual property. This sharing of income is subject to the terms of the policy being met by the creator of the NCI Intellectual Property, including the execution of all appropriate documentation to assign to the College all NCI Intellectual Property that may arise from a particular project or research. The aim is to achieve an equitable distribution of the income that arises from the commercialisation of NCI Intellectual Property between the college, the creator of the intellectual property and, where appropriate, a third party sponsor. The procedure for distribution of the actual net income outlined in this clause does not relate in any way to income earned by the college from equity in campus companies.</p><p>All direct expenses incurred by the college in the protection and commercialisation of NCI Intellectual Property that arises from a particular project or research (including legal and other costs involved in seeking patent protection for an invention and any subsequent investigation, development and promotion) will be recouped first by the college from the initial royalty or other income or lump sum before calculating the amount of income which can be shared with the relevant creators of the intellectual property in question.</p><p>Subject to the foregoing, the following guidelines (which may be amended from time to time by NCI) will be used in determining the distribution of net income received by NCI from the commercialisation of a particular piece of NCI Intellectual property:-</p><p>75% of net income actually received by NCI will be paid (subject to deduction as outlined above of applicable taxes and reimbursement of college costs associated with the protection and exploitation of NCI Intellectual Property (“Net Income”)) to the creators of the intellectual property that are classified as NCI personnel by the policy in such proportions as agreed between the relevant NCI personnel.</p><p>If more than one party is involved in the creation of the particular piece of NCI Intellectual Property, the division of payments between the parties will be based on their relative intellectual contributions as outlined in the Invention Disclosure Form. The division of payments will be agreed by the parties concerned and notified to NCI before a patent application is filed by the college. The college shall not distribute the Net Income unless the relevant parties have agreed the proportions between themselves. If the parties cannot agree the proportions then the college will determine the matter and the decision of the college shall be final (see Appendix 4).</p><p>It is essential that good research records are prepared during the course of each project. In the event of a dispute, the research records will be of prime importance in making an apportionment between the parties concerned.</p><p>The division of royalty and other income will generally be carried out within a reasonable timeframe upon receipt of such income. The college shall make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure where possible that creators of the intellectual property benefit from any income tax concessions on income from patents which may be available. For the avoidance of doubt none of the creators of the intellectual property shall be entitled to any share in royalty or other income from commercialisation of research unless NCI has received actual income or royalty payments from such commercialisation.</p><p>11.1.36                Non-Financial Rewards</p><p>It is recognised that the development of NCI Intellectual Property is dependent on the existence of satisfactory and equitable agreements on the division of income to provide meaningful rewards to creators of NCI Intellectual Property. However, the college may at its discretion provide non-financial rewards for such activities including academic recognition, improvement in the colleges, schools, centres and institutes facilities and funds for research.</p><p>11.1.37                 Organisations and Companies Collaborating with NCI on Research Projects</p><p>As an educational institute, NCI has an obligation to ensure the maximum public benefit from the exploitation of IP created from both publicly funded research and collaborative co-funded research. This is usually best maximised when IP is commercially exploited.</p><p>The NCI IPA Committee will conduct a commercial evaluation on the IP created/to be created in a research project and will seek information from the collaborating organisation on how it intends to commercialise the IP, and also determine the IP ownership rights they require from the project. The evaluation to determine the commercial value and IP ownership rights will include an examination of the criteria listed in paragraph 11 of this policy. All such information requested and provided will be treated in strict confidence.</p><p>Upon above assessment, the IPA Committee will decide on the IP ownership rights NCI requires and will agree the sale/assignment/option, licensing (exclusive or non-exclusive), or joint venture agreements or otherwise with the collaborating company to ensure maximum commercial benefits. A legal agreement will be executed between the parties, setting out the rights, entitlements and obligations of each party prior to the commencement of work on the project.</p><p>When making decisions regarding management and commercialisation of intellectual property arising from research which is wholly or partly funded by third parties, the College will take account of the following guidelines:</p><p>Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (ICSTI) National Code of Practice for Managing Intellectual Property Arising from Publicly Funded Research, published in 2004.</p><p>Advisory Science Council National Code of Practice for Managing and Commercialising Intellectual Property Arising from Public-Private Collaborative Research, published in 2005.</p><p>Funding Agency Requirements and Guidelines for Managing Research-Generated Intellectual Property, February 2006.</p><p>11.1.37.1          Publication of Research Results</p><p>It is college policy to encourage staff and students to place the results of their research in the public domain either through publication in Academic journals or presentation at conferences. This is a vital factor for academic recognition. In accordance with long-standing academic tradition, NCI does not and will not assert ownership of copyright in scholarly publications, books or artistic works of its employees unless there is an agreement to the contrary or patent pending. This exception to NCI ownership of intellectual property does not extend to copyright in software or to database rights. NCI will not assign rights to the usage of teaching materials to any third party without the prior agreement of the author/creator.</p><p>However, it must be recognised that premature publication or disclosure except on a confidential basis may make it impossible to obtain valid patent protection. The library will provide advice and assistance in relation to confidentiality agreements. The placing of a thesis in the college library without ensuring that accessibility is restricted constitutes publication. A typical arrangement for publication of a patentable invention is described in Appendix 7.</p><p>It is important to ensure that the intellectual property remains confidential and is not published for a limited period to enable adequate arrangements to be put in place for its protection where this is feasible. Publication that is in violation of the terms of any agreement between the college with the sponsor of the research or other third party must be avoided.</p><p>11.1.38                Conflict of Interest and Ethical Issues</p><p>It is the policy of the college that its management, staff, and others acting on its behalf have an obligation to avoid ethical, legal, financial, or other conflicts of interest and to ensure that their activities and interests do not conflict with their obligations to the college or its welfare. NCI requires full disclosure of potential areas of conflict and open discussion at the earliest possible opportunity. NCI will endeavour to alert staff and Other Relevant Parties to recognise where conflicts may occur and to manage and resolve these conflicts in line with its Conflicts Policy, which is currently under development. Any questions in relation to research ethics should be referred to the Technical Transfer Officer.</p><p>11.1.39                Dispute Resolution/Arbitration</p><p>Any dispute in relation to the policy or its effects will be dealt with as provided for in Appendix 4. Expenses incurred by the college in resolving disputes shall be deducted from royalty income before distribution unless an arbitrator is appointed. The costs of the arbitrator shall be borne by the Parties as outlined in Appendix 4.</p><p>11.1.40                Monitoring and Evaluation of Policy</p><p>This IP Policy will be monitored by the IPA Committee on an on-going basis. The IP Policy and related research, commercialisation and technology transfer will be monitored and evaluated on an annual basis and may be amended by NCI from time to time. All amendments to this IP Policy shall be posted on the NCI staff portal and such amendments shall be fully valid and effective from the date of posting.</p><p>Irish Statutory Provisions Governing Ownership of IP Rights</p><p>11.1.40.1           Copyright and Related Rights ACT, 2000 (“2000 Act”)</p><p>First ownership of copyright</p><p>Section 23 (1) of the 2000 Act provides that: “The author of a work shall be the first owner of the copyright unless the work is made by an employee in the course of employment, in which case the employer is the first owner of any copyright in the work, subject to any agreement to the contrary”.</p><p>Maker of database</p><p>Section 322 (2) of the 2000 Act provides that: Where a database is made by an employee in the course of employment, his or her employer shall be regarded as the maker of the database, subject to any agreement to the contrary”.</p><p>11.1.40.2           PATENTS ACT 1992 (“1992 Act”)</p><p>Right to a patent</p><p>Section 16(1) of the 1992 Act provides that: “The right to a patent shall belong to the inventor or his successor in title, but if the inventor is an employee the right to a patent shall be determined in accordance with the law of the state in which the employee is wholly or mainly employed or, if the identity of such state cannot be determined, in accordance with the law of the state in which the employer has his place of business to which the employee is attached.”</p><p>NOTE ON OWNERSHIP OF PATENTS UNDER IRISH LAW</p><p>Irish Law comprises Statute Law (legislation) and Common Law (legal principles developed through judicial decisions over time). The ownership of inventions discovered by an Irish employee working for an Irish employer is not specifically set out in any statutory provision but is covered by the Common Law principle that an employer owns the product of his employee’s work where that work was done in the course of the employment unless there is an agreement to the contrary.</p><p>Definition of Intellectual Property</p><p>11.1.40.3           Intellectual Property (IP)</p><p>Intellectual property as the tangible or intangible results of research, development, teaching, or other intellectual activity which is manifested in the form of copyrights, patents, trademarks, industrial designs and confidential/proprietary information. Intellectual property allows creativity and innovation to be captured and owned in the same way as physical property can be owned. Intellectual property includes individually and collectively all technical innovations, inventions, improvements, and/or discoveries, information, writings and software, whether or not patentable or otherwise susceptible to intellectual property protection, including technology and materials in their tangible form. This is the general term for intangible property rights which are a result of intellectual effort.</p><p>Patent</p><p>A patent grants, for a limited period, the right to exclude others from making, using, selling or importing the subject matter described by the claims of the patent except with the consent of the patentee. A patent contains a narrative description of the subject matter covered by the patent called the specification. It also contains one or more claims that describe the subject matter covered by the patent in highly technical and specific terms. A patent, as a form of 'industrial property', can be bought and sold, licensed or used by the owner either in whole or in part.</p><p>There are three basic criteria required to patent an invention. The invention must be novel, have an inventive step (i.e. it should not be obvious to someone skilled in the state-of-the-art) and it should have an industrial application. All three criteria must be met.</p><p>Trade Mark</p><p>A trade mark is the means by which a business identifies its goods or services and distinguishes them from the goods and services supplied by other businesses. The Trade Marks Act, 1996 defines a trade mark as \"any sign capable of being represented graphically which is capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings.\"</p><p>A trade mark may consist of words, (including personal names), designs, logos, letters, numerals or the shape of goods or of their packaging, or of other signs or indications that are capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of others.</p><p>Design</p><p>A design means the appearance of the whole or a part of a product resulting from the features of, in particular, the lines, contours, colour, shape, texture or materials of the product itself or its ornamentation. A registered design is a form of 'industrial property', which can be assigned, transferred, licensed or used by the owner. Design protection is territorial; in effect a design registered in Ireland is only valid in Ireland. Some aspects of the \"design\" may also be protected by copyright.</p><p>Copyright</p><p>Copyright is the legal term, which describes the rights given to authors/creators of certain categories of work. Copyright protection extends to the following works:</p><p>original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works;</p><p>sound recordings, films;</p><p>broadcasts, cable programmes;</p><p>the typographical arrangement of published editions;</p><p>computer programmes;</p><p>Original databases.</p><p>The owner of copyright is the author, meaning the person who creates the work. However, as copyright is a form of property, the right may be transferred to someone else, for example, to a publisher. Copyright is a property right and the owner of the work can control the use of the work, subject to certain exceptions.

(see Section 12 Disclosure and Evaluation)  In certain circumstances NCI may decide not to pursue commercialisation and it may instead decide to offer the opportunity to the inventor to pursue exploitation independently (under appropriate terms).</p><p>Principle – Protection of new IP:  It is intended that if the decision is taken to proceed with formal IP protection (such as patenting or other forms of formal IP protection) then this will be carried out in a timely manner, with the NCI TTO obtaining professional advice and involving the inventors/researchers  (see Section Disclosure and Evaluation)</p><p>Principle – Commercialisation:It is intended that Technology Transfer activities should be pursued in a timely manner through partnership between the TTO and the relevant inventors/researchers and with the industrial/commercial partner as appropriate. Various options for commercialisation will be considered[7] and the strategy devised to meet the aims of the IP Policy and to fit in with the terms and conditions of relevant sponsors of research as appropriate. (See Commercialisation Section)</p><p>Principle – Research Materials:  During Technology Transfer involving research materials, due consideration should be given to the retention of know-how and research materials for on-going research purposes.</p><p>Principle- Ownership:  It is intended that the IP Policy will clearly state that the ownership of IP generated by staff and students will be vested in NCI (Section on General Provisions of NCI Policy).  Having regard to the legal position regarding ownership, the IP policy will be supported by appropriate written agreements, which are acknowledged and agreed by all individuals involved in research.  Institute ownership of arising IP is a requirement of all state funding agencies in Ireland where projects are 100% publicly funded.   In accordance with long-standing academic tradition, NCI does not and will not assert ownership of copyright in scholarly publications, books or artistic works of its employees unless there is an agreement to the contrary or patent pending (Publication of Research Results Section). This exception to NCI ownership of intellectual property does not extend to copyright in software or to database rights. NCI will not assign rights to the usage of teaching materials to any third party without the prior agreement of the author/creator.</p><p>Principle - Sharing of Commercialisation Income: It is intended that the IP policy will include an incentive policy that explains policy on sharing of commercialisation income[8] with inventors/creators of commercialised IP.  See Section Distribution of Commercial Income.</p><p>Principle Conflicts of Interest:It is intended that procedures will be developed and implemented to address conflicts of interest[9].</p><p>Principle Monitoring & Evaluation: It is intended that the TTO will have clear systems for monitoring and evaluation and keep routine records of IP management measurement indicators (Section Monitoring and Evaluation of Policy</p><p>IP and other parties</p><p>IP and other organisations:  IP arising from research or other work sponsored by an external organisation shall be subject to the IP provisions that are stipulated in the related agreement between NCI and the external organisation.</p><p>Externally funded research:  For the avoidance of doubt, where IP is generated from research that is 100% funded by monies provided directly by the State, or by any not-for-profit financial instrument which has been established by an organisation or individual, and awarded through a public service organisation charged with the granting and dissemination of research funds, this IP will be exclusively and absolutely owned by NCI and subject to the terms of the granting body.</p><p>Non-employees:  The IP Policy also extends to Other Relevant Parties such as non-employees who participate in research projects at the college including visiting academics, industrial personnel etc. unless a specific waiver has been approved.</p><p>Consultancy:  Staff are permitted to engage in consultancy projects for third parties subject to compliance with NCI’s Consultancy Policy and their contract of employment and subject to written approval by the President of NCI. Any such approved consultancies must be disclosed to the IPA Committee. This NCI Consultancy Policy is currently under development.</p><p>[1] As the terms Staff, Students and Other Relevant Parties are defined in the NCI IP Policy.</p><p>[2] In the event that this document is to be signed by an Other Relevant Party (as that term is defined in the Introduction of the IP Policy), it may be appropriate to include this provision and the Schedule. To be considered on a case by case basis.</p><p>[3] As the terms Staff, Students and Other Relevant Parties are defined in the NCI IP Policy.</p><p>[4] This Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement forms Appendix 10 of the NCI IP Policy.</p><p>[5] To be considered on a case by case basis</p><p>[6] In the event that this document is to be signed by an Other Relevant Party (as that term is defined in the Introduction of the IP Policy), it may be appropriate to include this provision and the Schedule.

E.g. If company made 100,000 and royalty payable was 10,000 (NCI and inventor would share income 10,000 not 100,000), the other 90,000 would remain within the company.  Inventors may own the company.</p><p>[9] There is a need for a conflicts policy which is highly recommended by TTO officer network</p>"}

Context</p><p>QQI’s Core Policies and Criteria for the Validation by QQI of Programmes of Education and Training (CPCV) prescribes the process and criteria to be used for validation as well as the documentation required when submitting an application for the validation of a new programme. The steps below are based on this policy.</p><p>Interpretation Principle: If any part of this procedure is found or interpreted to be inconsistent with the CPCV then QQI policy should be followed instead.</p><p>1.1  Scope</p><p>1.1.1     Level on the National Framework of Qualifications</p><p>This procedure applies to taught programmes at Level 6-9 on the Irish National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) for submission to QQI for validation.</p><p>1.1.2.   Subject Area</p><p>The scope of devolved responsibility is limited to taught programmes at Level 6-9 on the NFQ in Business, Computing, Psychology (excluding clinical psychology) and Education excluding:</p><p>First time collaborative provision of programmes where there is no collaborative agreement or relationship already in place</p><p>Transnational programmes delivered in new transnational destinations</p><p>Programmes leading to joint awards</p><p>Statutory Apprenticeship programmes</p><p>1.1.3.   Target Learner Group</p><p>Programmes may be offered on a full or part-time basis.</p><p>1.1.4.   Teaching & Learning Modalities</p><p>Programmes may be offered in traditional (face-to-face) or blended learning modes. Programmes developed for blended learning are developed according to NCI’s quality assurance policies and procedures relating to programmes using technology mediated learning, which are aligned with QQI’s Statutory Quality Assurance Guidelines for Providers of Blended Learning Programmes. Modules that are first validated as part of a principal programme and are subsequently developed as Special Purpose Awards (Micro-Credentials) can be validated for fully online delivery.</p><p>1.1.5.   Location</p><p>Programmes leading to major awards may be delivered at the IFSC campus only. Those leading to minor or special purpose awards may be delivered at an off-campus location. These locations must be approved by QQI as part of the validation of the programme and are only proposed by NCI once they have been reviewed according to the Off-Campus Provision Policy (QAM Section 3.11).</p><p>1.2.  Responsibilities within NCI</p><p>The Director of Quality and Institutional Effectiveness (DQIE) is responsible for ensuring the procedures agreed in this document are implemented consistently and adhered to by all individuals involved in the development and validation of programmes at NCI. The below individuals are responsible for implementing the procedures regarding the arrangement of the Independent Evaluation Report (IER) during the programme validation process.</p><p>1.2.1.    Director of Quality and Institutional Effectiveness</p><p>The Director of Quality and Institutional Effectiveness (DQIE), or nominee within the QIE Office is responsible for:</p><p>Managing the development of the programme(s) alongside the relevant Dean of School</p><p>Coordinating the internal validation process as outlined in QAH Section 3.2.3</p><p>Completing Step 0, Step 1 and Steps 5-8 in the Validation Process as outlined below</p><p>Coordinating the components of Step 3 as outlined below</p><p>Communicating with the QQI and the members of the Independent Evaluation Panel (IEP) as required</p><p>Maintaining accurate regards of the Validation Process and managing the version control mechanisms for the related documentation</p><p>Participating in the review of the Validation Process as outlined in Section 2 below as requested by QQI</p><p>1.2.2.

Programme Director (provisional)</p><p>The Programme Director is responsible for developing a programme of education and training as per the policies and procedures outlined in QAH Section 3.2, in addition to:</p><p>Submitting all documentation to DQIE as detailed in Section 2 below</p><p>Liaising with the Programme Team and compiling the Programme Team’s response to the IER as per Step 7 in the Validation Process</p><p>1.2.4.   Programme Team (provisional)</p><p>The Programme Team is involved in the different stages of the development of a programme of education and training as per the policies and procedures outlined in QAH Section 3.2, in addition to:</p><p>contributing and preparing all documentation required by DQIE under the guidance of the Programme Director</p><p>considering the special conditions of validation and recommendations to the provider included in the IER and contributing to the Programme Team’s response to the IER under the guidance of the Programme Director</p><p>1.3.  Role of the Quality and Institutional Effectiveness (QIE) Office</p><p>The Quality and Institutional Effectiveness (QIE) Office will provide administrative support to the Independent Evaluation Panel (IEP) throughout the validation process. When the IEP is participating in the review and revalidation of an existing programme, the QIE Office will review the Terms of Reference in consultation with the Panel Chairperson. The policies and procedures relating to programme review and revalidation are outlined in QAH Section 3.8.</p><p>1.3.1.    Communication between NCI and QQI</p><p>All communication relating to the validation process between NCI and QQI, including the Independent Evaluation Panel (IEP), will be made by the Director QIE or nominee in the QIE Office. No member of the Programme Team, or any other member of NCI staff associated with the programme(s) being evaluated, is to contact QQI or the IEP directly.</p><p>1.4  Pre-Requisites</p><p>The procedure for arranging the IER cannot commence until the internal validation process for new programmes as outlined in QAH Section 3.2.3 has been completed. This process includes the initial programme proposal and feasibility study and concludes with the Internal Review Panel, which considers the programme’s compliance with QQI’s validation criteria. Once the Programme Team have satisfied any conditions or recommendations made by the panel, the programme can be submitted to the Academic Operations Committee for approval to proceed with the validation.</p><p>1.5  Related NCI Policies and Procedures</p><p>Policy & Procedures for the Development & Validation of Programmes Leading to QQI Higher Education Awards (QAH Section 3.2)</p><p>Policy and Procedures for Programme Review and Revalidation (QAH Section 3.8)</p><p>Policy and Procedures for the Design, Approval and Quality Management of Collaborative Provision & Transnational Education Programmes (QAH Section 3.6)</p><p>Validation Process</p><p>Devolved responsibility for arrangement of the IER commences at Step 3 and ends at Step 7 of the validation process. These steps apply to all programmes that are submitted to QQI for validation, excluding those identified in Section 1.1.2 above. Please refer to Appendix 1 for an indicative timeline of the Validation Process. An diagrammatic overview of the validation process is provided below.</p><ol><li>Application Processes</li><p>To facilitate an efficient validation process, the following 3 activities take place shortly before the programme is due to be submitted to QQI for validation:</p><p>Notification of the application to QQI</p><p>Review of validation documentation</p><p>Preparing nominations for the Independent Evaluation Panel</p><li>Step 0 (Part 1) Notification of Application to QQI</li><p>The Director of Quality and Institutional Effectiveness (DQIE), or nominee, will formally advise QQI that an application is expected to be made one month before the application is scheduled to be completed. This process triggers the issue of an invoice from QQI and a purchase order will then be generated by the DQIE or nominee.</p><li>Step 0 (Part 2) Review of Validation Documentation</li><p>The DQIE, or other person appointed by Academic Council, shall review the validation documentation to determine whether the programme:</p><p>complies with QQI’s Policies and Criteria for the Validation of Programmes of Education and Training and the guidelines in Programme Validation Manual for Programmes of HET and Apprenticeships (FET and HET).</p><p>has been developed and internally validated according to NCI’s Policy & Procedures for the Development & Validation of Programmes Leading to QQI Higher Education Awards (QAH Section 3.2).</p><p>has appropriate measures for the Protection for Enrolled Learners in accordance with QQI Protocols for Implementation.</p><p>has been critically evaluated against QQI’s validation criteria by the Programme Team using the “Self-Evaluation Against QQI Validation Criteria” template.</p><p>The outcomes of the review of the validation documentation are:</p><p>Recommendation that the programme is submitted to QQI for validation. Such a recommendation will only be made where all the validation documentation required by the CPCV is fully complete and finalised including a Self-Assessment Report against the QQI validation criteria</p><p>Recommendation that the documentation is returned to the Programme Development Team for revision based on specific conditions and/or recommendations.</p><p>Recommendation that the programme validation process is paused and the programme is not submitted to QQI for validation at this time. The documentation is returned to the Programme Development Team for redevelopment so it can address issues of non-compliance with QQI’s validation criteria.</p><li>Step 0 (Part 3) Nominations for the Independent Evaluation Panel</li><p>The external validation of programmes involves the evaluation of the programmes against QQI’s validation criteria by the Independent Evaluation Panel (IEP). The IEP is required to make an impartial judgement on the rationale for the programme and its objectives, the learning outcomes and curriculum structure, and the teaching, learning and assessment strategy of the programme and its constituent modules. The IEP consists of quality assurance and subject matter experts who have the capacity to review the programme against the applicable QQI validation criteria and to make a formal recommendation to QQI that the programme should be validated. Panel members will:</p><p>be external to and independent of NCI</p><p>have expertise in relevant quality assurance policies and procedures, pedagogy, and assessment, and/or the programme’s discipline</p><p>be capable of reviewing the programme against comparable programmes both nationally and internationally national and international</p><p>have the expertise to substantiate their recommendation to QQI to approve or refuse a programme for validation</p><p>The IEP is constituted on a case-by-case basis depending on the programme(s) being considered for validation and in accordance with QQI’s CPCV. In all instances, the IEP must have a 3:2 gender balance.</p><li>Step 0 (Part 3a) Sourcing Panel Members</li><p>The Director of Quality and Institutional Effectiveness (DQIE) is responsible for constituting the nominated panel and approving nominations made to QQI. The Programme Director will make several nominations to the DQIE who will determine their eligibility based on experience and expertise. Nominations will also be sourced through NCI’s staff and faculty networks and the QIE Office’s CRM system.</p><p>When contacted, nominees will be provided with sufficient information to allow them to decide whether their workload permits them to fully participate in the external programme validation process. This information includes:</p><p>The number of programmes due to be evaluated by the panel, the structure of the programmes and their level on the NFQ</p><p>The expected commitment in terms of:</p><p>the time required to review the documentation in advance of the panel meeting</p><p>the expected duration of the panel meeting, including any preparatory meetings</p><p>correspondence between the Panel Chairperson and the Report Writer and the schedule to completion for the Independent Evaluation Report</p><p>While the DQIE will approve nominations for the IEP, the panel must be formally approved by QQI before progressing any further in the external validation process.</p><li>Step 0 (Part 3b) Panel Composition</li><p>The Independent Evaluation Panel (IEP) for Major, Minor and Special Purpose Awards is comprised of the following members:</p><p>Panel Chairperson – Registrar, senior academic or quality assurance expert</p><p>Report Writer – education consultant or quality assurance expert</p><p>Subject Matter Experts – at least two senior academics in the discipline area from the university sector and/or coordinator of a comparable programme (in the case of Master programmes, one of the Subject Matter Experts should be an academic from an international Higher Education Institution)</p><p>Industry Representative – manager/employer/practitioner from the sector that graduates are expected to be employed in</p><p>Learner Representative – a current learner on or recent graduate from a comparable programme</p><p>In addition to the above, the Panel Chairperson is expected to have completed the relevant QQI training, the Report Writer will have expertise regarding NFQ Award Standards and QQI’s CPCV, and the Learner Representative will have completed training delivered by the National Student Engagement Programme (NStEP). Additional panel members may be required to address specific quality assurance procedures relating to work-based learning, blended and online delivery, and supervision of research projects.</p><p>In the case of modules that are first validated as part of a principal programme and are subsequently developed as Special Purpose Awards (Micro-Credentials), the IEP will consist of a Panel Chairperson (who also fulfils the duties of the Report Writer) and two Subject Matter Experts.</p><li>Step 0 (Part 3c) Criteria for the Nomination of Expert Panel Members</li><p>As explained in Section 6.1 of QQI’s Core Policies and Criteria for the Validation of Programmes of Education and Training, QQI is ultimately responsible for appointing the panel and “will exercise its judgment as to the number of evaluators that may be required in respect of the programme in question and the competences required having regard to the particular programme and the relevant QQI awards standards.” However, the devolved responsibility for arranging the Independent Evaluation Report (IER) allows NCI to arrange nominations for the Independent Evaluation Panel (IEP). To ensure the IEP can fulfil its responsibilities in the external validation process, the following criteria for nominations must be satisfied:</p><p>nominees must be sufficiently and demonstrably external to and independent of NCI. To this end:</p><p>A period of five years should have elapsed before former staff members of NCI can be nominated to a panel</p><p>A period of five years should have elapsed before former external examiners can be nominated to a panel</p><p>A period of five years should have elapsed before graduates of NCI can be nominated to the panel</p><p>nominees must declare any actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest regarding their responsibilities as a member of the IEP*</p><p>nominees must be included in QQI’s Register of Experts**</p><p>* While the DQIE will consider any conflicts of interest before approaching a potential nominee, the nominee must declare any conflicts of interest that the DQIE may not be aware of as per Section 2.1.3.4 below.</p><p>** If a nominee is not already included in QQI’s Register of Experts, s/he must complete an Expert’s Details Form, which will be submitted to QQI on their behalf by DQIE.</p><p>When contacting prospective nominees to ascertain availability and willingness to participate, the QIE Office will make it clear to nominees that their participation on the panel is subject to agreement of QQI and that non-selection in the final agreed panel is subject to ensuring balance and is not a reflection on their suitability.</p><p>Expenses incurred by panel members during activities relating to the IEP are covered by NCI. Standard public sector norms apply to those who are employed in an Irish university, whereas panel members who are not employed by an Irish university will be reimbursed according to QQI’s current guidelines regarding panel expenses</p><p>The DQIE will liaise with nominees to ensure that they formally accept nomination and the terms of participation on the panel in accordance with QQI policy on participation on panels. The DQIE is responsible for ensuring a 3:2 gender balance on the panel, that there is sufficient variety of HEIs represented on the panel and that the Panel Chairperson and Report Writer are rotated sufficiently between different IEPs.</p><li>Step 0 (Part 3d) Conflict of Interest</li><p>Panel nominees will be required to read QQI’s Considerations for Independent Evaluators in QQI Validation / QA Approval Processes (including conflicts of interest matters) and make all relevant declarations (see Appendix 3).</p><li>Step 0 (Part 3e) Communication with Panel Members</li><p>Communication with Panel members in relation to the validation process is made exclusively by the QIE Office. No other member of NCI staff may communicate with a panel member on matters relating to the validation/revalidation event.</p><li>Step 1: Application to QQI</li><p>The following documents will be submitted as part of the application to QQI for validation of Major, Minor and Special Purpose Awards:</p><p>Programme Validation Descriptor</p><p>Self-Evaluation Against Validation Criteria</p><p>Fee Cover Note</p><p>Confirmation of Protection for Enrolled Learner arrangement where appropriate</p><p>Panel Nominations pack which includes for each nominee:</p><p>Signed QQI Confidentiality and Conflict of Interest Declaration</p><p>Signed Expert Details Form (if required)</p><p>Signed Data Protection Form (see Appendix 2)</p><p>Confirmation that the invoice for validation has been paid</p><p>In the case of modules that are first validated as part of a principal programme and are subsequently developed as Special Purpose Awards (Micro-Credentials), the Programme Validation Descriptor is significantly different to that submitted for Major, Minor and Special Purpose Awards. For that reason, a Self-Evaluation Report will be submitted, which outlines the rationale for delivering the module(s) as a stand-alone programme in terms of learner demand, satisfying a genuine educational and/or training need, and the currency of curriculum content and learning outcomes.</p><li>Step 1 must be completed by the DQIE or nominee at least 6 weeks prior to any planned Panel Meeting date (see Section 2.4.3 below).</li><li>Step 2: Application Screening by QQI</li><p>Upon receipt of the application, QQI will screen the documentation as outlined in Section 5.5 of the CPCV.  It is at this point that QQI will formally advise NCI if the Validation Panel Meeting and arrangement of the Independent Evaluation Report are to be managed under devolved responsibility. The subsequent stages in this process cannot commence until NCI receives confirmation in writing that application screening has taken place and that devolved responsibility has been approved.</p><li>Step 3: Independent Evaluation</li><p>When arranging the Validation Panel Meeting, the DQIE will give due regard to the workload associated with reviewing all relevant documentation and corresponding during the preparation and approval of the Independent Evaluation Report (IER). Sufficient time will be made available to the panel to review the documentation prior to the Validation Panel Meeting, to evaluate the programme(s) during the meeting itself, and to prepare and approve the IER.</p><li>Step 3 (Part 1) Provision of Documentation to the Independent Evaluation Panel</li><p>The documentation required by the panel to fulfil their duties must be provided at least 2 weeks prior to the Validation Panel Meeting. In the case of programme validations of Major, Minor and Special Purpose Awards, this documentation will include:</p><p>Programme Validation Descriptor</p><p>Self-Evaluation Against the QQI Validation Criteria</p><p>Appendices</p><p>Agenda for the Validation Panel Meeting</p><p>In the case of modules that are first validated as part of a principal programme and are subsequently developed as Special Purpose Awards (Micro-Credentials), this documentation will also include a Self-Evaluation Report for each distinct programme and a panel briefing pack outlining the desk-review process.</p><p>When the Independent Evaluation Panel (IEP) is participating in the review and revalidation of an existing programme, the documentation will include the Terms of Reference for Programme Review and the Provider’s Programme Review Report. The policies and procedures relating to programme review and revalidation are outlined in QAH Section 3.8.</p><p>In addition to the above documentation, the IEP will be provided with links to:</p><p>NCI’s Quality Assurance Handbook (QAH)</p><p>QQI’s Policies and Criteria for the Validation of Programmes of Education and Training</p><p>Award Standards for Higher Education (relevant to programme(s) being considered for re/validation</p><p>QQI’s Statutory Quality Assurance Guidelines for Providers of Blended Learning Programmes (If applicable)</p><li>Step 3 (Part 2) Preparatory Panel Meeting</li><p>Panel members are invited to complete an ‘Initial Comments’ form in advance of the meeting and forward this directly to the Panel Chairperson. In the case of major award programmes, the expert panel will normally meet the evening before the validation panel meeting to discuss the application, allocate areas of expertise between the panel members and identify areas for discussion with the Programme Team. In all cases, the agenda will allow sufficient time for the panel to deliberate before, during and after the meeting with programme staff.</p><p>The Panel Chairperson may request additional information and/or supplementary documentation to elaborate the context of the programme development process or to further explain the rational for providing the programme as proposed. This can include quality assurance policies and procedures, evidence of stakeholder engagement from the programme development process or documents relating to institutional strategies. The Director of Quality and Institutional Effectiveness (DQIE) will provide such additional information requested by the Panel Chairperson.</p><li>Step 3 (Part 3) Validation Panel Meeting</li><p>The Validation Panel Meeting includes a site visit by the Independent Evaluation Panel (IEP), which is organised by the Quality and Institutional Effectiveness (QIE) Office. The IEP will meet with the Programme Team to discuss any issues that arose from their review of the programme(s) under consideration. QQI will be invited to observe the validation panel meeting as appropriate.</p><p>Should a conflict of interest arise during the site visit, the relevant procedures outlined in</p><p>current QQI guidelines should be used and QQI should be notified immediately.</p><p>The IEP will evaluate the programme(s) against QQI’s Core Policies and Criteria for the Validation by QQI of Programmes of Education and Training and will provide the Programme Team with provisional feedback outlining the panel’s intention to make one of the one of the following recommendations:</p><p>Recommendation</p><p>Reason</p><p>Validate</p><p>Satisfactory of Core policies and criteria for the validation by QQI of programmes of education and training.</p><p>Validate subject to special conditions</p><p>Satisfactory subject to proposed special conditions, which may include proposed pre-validation conditions, i.e. proposed (minor) things to be done to a programme that almost fully meets the validation criteria before QQI makes a determination.</p><p>Refuse to validate</p><p>Not satisfactory of Core policies and criteria for the validation by QQI of programmes of education and training.</p><p>In the case of modules that are first validated as part of a principal programme and are subsequently developed as Special Purpose Awards (Micro-Credentials), the Validation Panel Meeting is replaced by a desk review of the documentation specified in Section 2.4.1 above. The Panel Chairperson can request additional information regarding the programme to support the panel in arriving at one of the above recommendations. In such instances, the Panel Chairperson will submit the “Request for Further Information” form (see Appendix 4) to the Director of Quality and Institutional Effectiveness, who will liaise with the programme Team to ensure all requests are accommodated.</p><p>When the Independent Evaluation Panel (IEP) is participating in the review and revalidation of an existing programme, panel members are expected to consider the Provider’s Programme Review Report and to evaluate the programme in terms of the proposed modifications to the existing iteration of the programme. documentation will include the Terms of Reference for Programme Review and the Provider’s Programme Review Report. The policies and procedures relating to programme review and revalidation are outlined in QAH Section 3.8.</p><li>Step 4: Preparation of the Independent Evaluation Report</li><p>The Report Writer will prepare the draft Independent Evaluation Report (IER) within an agreed timeframe, normally two weeks after the Validation Panel Meeting. The IER is composed according to QQI’s approved template and Report Writing Guidelines and is submitted directly to the Director of Quality and Institutional Effectiveness (DQIE) by the Panel Chairperson.</p><p>When the Independent Evaluation Panel (IEP) is participating in the review and revalidation of an existing programme, the Report Writer will also complete the relevant sections of the Provider’s Programme Review Report, indicating the panel’s evaluation of the analyses conducted by the Programme Team during the review process and the proposed modifications to the programme(s) informed by this process. The policies and procedures relating to programme review and revalidation are outlined in QAH Section 3.8.</p><li>Step 5: Factual Accuracy Check</li><p>The Director of Quality and Institutional Effectiveness (DQIE) or nominee will review the draft Independent Evaluation Report (IER) to determine its factual accuracy. If any factual errors are identified, these will be communicated to the Panel Chairperson and a revised version will be prepared. Once DQIE is satisfied with the factual accuracy of the IER, the Panel Chairperson will sign-off on this final draft version.</p><li>Step 6: Submission of the Independent Evaluation Report to QQI</li><p>The Director of Quality and Institutional Effectiveness (DQIE), or nominee, will submit the final draft Independent Evaluation Report (IER) to QQI. QQI will review the final draft IER, within two weeks of receipt, and if accepted  QQI will formally request in writing that NCI responds to all special conditions of validation and recommendations to the provider as outlined in the report. The QIE Office will liaise with the Programme Team to ensure that each special condition of validation and recommendation to the provider is responded to appropriately and the necessary changes made to the Validation Descriptor(s). The DQIE or nominee will correspond with the Independent Evaluation Panel (IEP) on behalf of the Programme Team and provide the Programme Team’s response to the IER and the final version of the Validation Descriptor(s).</p><li>Off</li><p>The Independent Evaluation Panel (IEP) will consider the Programme Team’s response to the Independent Evaluation Report (IER) and decide if each special condition of validation has been satisfied and each recommendation to the provider has been considered. Once the IEP is satisfied with the Programme Team’s response, the Panel Chairperson will provide formal acceptance of the response to the Director of Quality and Institutional Effectiveness (DQIE).</p><li>Step 8: Submission to QQI for Validation</li><p>The Director of Quality and Institutional Effectiveness (DQIE) will submit the programme(s) to QQI for consideration by the Programme & Awards Executive Committee (PAEC). The submission will be made at least 3 weeks prior to the next scheduled PAEC meeting via Qhub and will consist of the following documentation:</p><p>Independent Evaluation Report (IER) initially reviewed by QQI</p><p>Programme Team’s Response to the IER</p><p>Confirmation of the Panel Chairperson’s acceptance of the above</p><p>Validation Descriptor modified as required by the above</p><p>The IER may be adopted without amendment or additional conditions may be imposed by the PAEC. QQI will issue the Certificate of Validation and the Programme Schedule to the Director of Quality and Institutional Effectiveness (DQIE). Any inconsistencies between these documents and the programme as proposed in Validation Descriptor will be communicated to QQI by the DQIE for immediate correction.</p><p>2.    Disputes and Failure of the Validation Process</p><p>3.1. Dispute Regarding the Validity of the Independent Evaluation Report</p><p>If the Director of Quality and Institutional Effectiveness (DQIE) is concerned about the validity of the Independent Evaluation Report (IER) in terms of its factual accuracy or the special conditions of validation imposed by the Independent Evaluation Panel (IEP), QQI will be informed immediately and will assume responsibility for managing the validation process from Step 5 onwards.</p><p>3.    Fees & Expenses</p><p>Where NCI undertakes devolved responsibility for the organisation of the Independent Evaluation Report (IER), a 50% deduction will be applied by QQI to the standard validation fee. QQI may charge an additional fee if, for any reason, it becomes necessary to assume responsibility for the management of the validation process. The validation fee will be paid to QQI during Step 1 of the validation process as outlined above. All reasonable expenses incurred by the Independent Evaluation Panel (IEP) will be reimbursed by NCI, while payment to the panel members for services provided will be made in accordance with QQI’s current policies.</p><p>4.    Freedom of Information & Data Protection</p><p>Both QQI and NCI are subject to Freedom of Information legislation and must comply with GDPR requirements. The final report is the record of this process and the final programme submission document is the record of the approved programme. These records are subject to the document retention and disposal policies of NCI.</p><p>Personal data relating to nominated and actual panel members will be retained by the Quality and Institutional Effectiveness (QIE) Office in accordance with current data protection legislation and the document retention and disposal policies of NCI (QAH Section 9.5). Personal data relating to nominated and actual panel members will only be transferred to QQI with the consent of the data subject for the purpose specified in “NCI Data Protection Form” (Appendix 2).</p><p>5.    Evaluation of the Process</p><p>At the close of each event, a questionnaire is sent to each panel member by QQI. QQI will share the overall outcomes of surveys relating to NCI as part of this process.</p><p>At the discretion of the Director of Quality and Institutional Effectiveness (DQIE), a periodic evaluation of the process and outcomes of both internal and external validation events will be undertaken to review themes such as:</p><p>Patterns in conditions & recommendations</p><p>Sourcing of panel members</p><p>Faculty and other relevant staff members perceptions of the validation process</p><p>The timing of this review will be determined by the level and volume of validation activity. The outcomes will inform review of policy and procedure with respect to programme development and validation, professional development events and/or sectoral consultations.</p><p>Both NCI and QQI will monitor the implementation of the process and provide feedback on its operation.</p><p>6.    Appendices</p><p>Appendix 1: Indicative Timeline of Validation Process</p><p>This timeline represents the ‘best case scenario’ assuming all stages in the validation process are completed properly and both NCI and QQI meet the agreed levels of service outlined in this memorandum of agreement.</p><p>Appendix 2: NCI Data Protection Form</p><p>I agree to my personal and contact details provided during the course of this event being held electronically by NCI for the purpose of future contact in relation to participation in programme validation panels, external examinership, or similar academic activities.</p><p>Yes/No</p><p>I agree to share my personal contact details provided during the course of this event with Qualifications and Quality Assurance Ireland (QQI) for the purpose of evaluating this programme for validation and for evaluating the process of validation.</p><p>Yes/No</p><p>Signed ________________________________                                Date:_________________</p><p>Data Protection Notice</p><p>Any personal data provided to the National College of Ireland (“NCI”),  through or in connection this form will be processed by NCI as data controller  for the purposes of nominating evaluators for programme evaluation panels, external examiners or related academic activities.

The following extract from QQI’s “Policies and Criteria for The Validation of Programmes of Education and Training” addresses independent evaluators (see section 6 of the core validation policy document for more detailed information). Note that references to the validation process should be read to include QA approval processes also.</p><p>Evaluators will be objective and independent of the programme and its providers e.g. free of conflicting interests.</p><p>Any related interests must be declared in the independent evaluation report and will be published.</p><p>Independent evaluators must be competent to make a recommendation on whether or not the programme should be validated (see the introduction for unit (6)). Competence means the capacity to make judgements against the applicable QQI validation criteria. Specifically, an evaluator or an evaluation group will be selected to have the competence to justify their recommendation whatever it may be (see the introduction for unit (6)).</p><p>Typically, evaluation groups (panels) will have expertise in the programme’s discipline area and in generic areas including pedagogy, assessment, quality assurance and all the other areas indicated by QQI’s validation criteria. QQI will exercise its judgment as to the number of evaluators that may be required in respect of the programme in question and the competences required having regard to the particular programme and the relevant QQI awards standards. For certain programmes one or two evaluators may be sufficient, however a group of three or more evaluators is likely to be required where the applicable QQI awards standards are broadly determined (i.e. the expected learning outcomes are not determined in detail by QQI leaving a lot of room for interpretation as is normally the case for HET awards standards). For the independent evaluation of applications for the validation of programmes leading to higher education and training awards, the groups of evaluators will include (a) student member(s) and will be composed in compliance with ESG standard 2.4.</p><p>Training will be provided to independent evaluators where QQI considers this necessary.</p><p>An evaluator who feels that they do not have the competence to evaluate an application should not accept an invitation to act or if this realisation, or a conflict of interest, occurs following acceptance should inform QQI without delay.</p><p>Members of the QQI Board and its Committees</p><p>Members of the QQI Board or any committee of the Board should not be appointed on the basis that they have a role in the determination of the application.</p><p>Conflicts of interest</p><p>Generally, QQI has a firm policy of not appointing persons as evaluators or reviewers in any case where there is any foreseen possibility of conflict of interest. Even the appearance of conflict of interest, where none exists, can damage the credibility of the person selected and the evaluation/review process.</p><p>The instances listed below are given as examples. They are not intended to comprise an exhaustive list of situations where a conflict of interest might arise.</p><p>Independence could be compromised, or perceived to be compromised, for the following groups.</p><p>Current or previous appointment holders in the provider making the application for validation (e.g. employees, consultants, guest lecturers/trainers, external examiners/authenticators, research supervisors and such like).</p><p>Former employees, governors, directors, consultants and graduates (except for learner representatives) of the provider making the application for validation. These individuals are not normally eligible to serve as members of a validation panel (independent evaluation group) for a programme of the provider.</p><p>Persons who have had long-standing service, or who are retired from their employment with the provider making the application for validation. Normally these individuals should not participate in any validation panel for a programme of that provider.</p><p>Collaborators in joint projects (including research initiatives) involving the provider making the application for validation. Where an assessor is concerned regarding existing minor collaborations in a particular field of study or at any institutional level, he/she should consult the QQI executive for an adjudication on suitability.</p><p>Persons who have a potential future conflict of interest.</p><p>Persons with family or other relationship with any members employed by or attending the provider making the application for validation might have a conflict of interest. They should inform the provider and QQI prior to involvement in the validation process, so that an appropriate judgement can be made as to the advisability of the individual’s involvement.</p><p>Persons with direct financial interest of any sort, including the holding of shares in a company associated with that provider making the application for validation. In the case of a private, for-profit provider, no panel member, appointed to evaluate or review an application, may have a direct financial interest of any sort, including the holding of shares in a company associated with that provider.</p><p>Direct competitors in a particular industry or professional environment or in a specific geographical location may have a conflict of interest, but will not automatically be deemed to be conflicted.</p><p>Since cases can arise where the possible appearance of a conflict of interest is not generally known, the primary responsibility for disclosing such a possibility rests on the prospective independent evaluator.</p><p>Prospective QQI independent evaluators (panel members) are required to declare any relevant interests and potential conflicts of interest prior to appointment. If there are no relevant interests or conflicts this should be declared. The declarations will be published with the panel report (e.g. the independent evaluation report of the validation / QA approval process).</p><p>In addition, the provider involved (making the application for validation / QA Approval) will be informed of the intended panel by QQI and asked to declare any potential conflicts of interest prior to appointment of the panel.</p><p>Where an independent evaluator’s potential conflict of interest emerges after appointment, they should inform QQI without delay and inform the panel chairperson.</p><p>Should the provider making the application for validation / QA Approval become aware of a conflict of interest after the panel has been appointed it should inform QQI without delay and inform the panel chairperson.</p><p>In such cases, the QQI executive will rule on the continuing eligibility of the panel member.</p><p>Confidentiality</p><p>The documentation (including that covered by unit (5.5) of Core Policies And Criteria For The Validation By QQI Of Programmes Of Education And Training) relating to an application for validation will be made available confidentially to QQI staff and persons and organisations involved in their evaluation. Nevertheless, it should be noted that QQI is subject to the Freedom of Information legislation and QQI records are subject to requests under the Freedom of Information Act.</p><p>GDPR Agreement</p><p>This agreement (“Agreement”) is made between Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) and XXXX (name of reviewer) (the Reviewer/Evaluator). QQI and the Reviewer/Evaluator have agreed to enter into this agreement for the purposes of ensuring compliance with Data Protection Legislation, inter alia, Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (General Data Protection Regulation) (hereinafter “the GDPR”).

For the purposes of the Agreement, this shall be referred to as the Review.</p><p>QQI and the Reviewer/Evaluator have agreed that the Reviewer/Evaluator is a processor as defined in Article 28 of the GDPR as he/she carries out processing of data on behalf of QQI. QQI is a controller of the data for the purposes of the GDPR.</p><p>This Agreement is limited to personal data provided by QQI to the Reviewer/Evaluator and to personal data provided by the relevant provider to the Reviewer/Evaluator, and to personal data duly shared between reviewers/evaluators, for the purposes of a Review, (hereinafter “the data”).</p><p>This data may include:</p><p>(a) Personal data of providers;</p><p>(b) Personal data of members of staff of providers;</p><p>(c) Personal data of enrolled learners or prospective learners of providers;</p><p>(d) Personal data of reviewers/evaluators.</p><p>This data should not be used by the Reviewer/Evaluator for any other purpose other than the carrying out of the Review. The Reviewer/Evaluator shall not transfer personal data to a third country or an international organisation (as defined in the GDPR), unless required to do so by Union or Member State law, in such a case the Reviewer/Evaluator shall inform QQI of that legal requirement before processing.</p><p>The Reviewer/Evaluator understands that he/she is bound by the terms of the Confidentiality Clause which he/she has separately entered into.</p><p>The Reviewer/Evaluator shall not engage another processor for the processing of the data without prior specific written authorisation of QQI as per Article 28.2 of the GDPR. For the avoidance of doubt, QQI hereby gives prior specific written authorisation to the Reviewer/Evaluator to share the data with the other reviewers/evaluators engaged in the specific Review, and this Agreement applies equally to all data received by the Reviewer/Evaluator from fellow reviewers/evaluators in relation to the Review.</p><p>The data held by the Reviewer/Evaluator for each Review should be deleted at the end of each Review, unless otherwise instructed in writing by QQI. Any hard copy data shall be shredded; if shredding facilities are not available to the Reviewer/Evaluator then they shall be returned to QQI.</p><p>The Reviewer/Evaluator will implement appropriate technical and organisational security measures to protect the personal data in his/her possession. The Reviewer/Evaluator will ensure that these measures comply with the requirements of the GDPR.</p><p>As required by Article 33(2) of the GDPR, the Reviewer/Evaluator will inform QQI of any personal data breach without undue delay. The Reviewer/Evaluator will cooperate with any enquiries or investigations by the Data Protection Commissioner. The Reviewer/Evaluator will assist QQI in ensuring compliance with QQI’s obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data subject’s rights laid down in chapter III of the GDPR. The Reviewer/Evaluator will cooperate fully with QQI to ensure compliance with the obligations of QQI pursuant to articles 32 to 36 of the GDPR.</p><p>The Reviewer/Evaluator will make available to QQI all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in this Article and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by QQI or another auditor mandated by QQI.</p><p>This Agreement terminates at the same time as the agreement between QQI and the Reviewer/Evaluator in relation to the Review. Notwithstanding the expiry or termination of this Agreement for any reason, the provisions of this Agreement shall continue to apply to any personal data in the possession of either party which was covered by the agreement.</p><p>This agreement shall be governed by Irish law and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Irish courts.</p><p>Declarations:</p><p>I wish to declare the following interests and understand that this declaration will be included in the validation / QA Approval report:</p><p>I have read the above and confirm that I do not have any conflicts of interest in participating in the evaluation of application for QA Approval by [provider]:</p><p>I understand that the application documentation and materials are confidential and must (along with any copies made) be returned to QQI or destroyed once the Independent Evaluation Report has been finalised.

To this end, the Academic Council has approved the processes and procedures involved in implementing programme quality assurance in the College and these are kept under continuous review.</p><p>This handbook is the documented Quality Assurance & Enhancement System (QAES) and should always be viewed as a working document which is reviewed and updated periodically in the light of experience in implementing its procedures and feedback received from staff, learners and outside interests.</p><p>Achievement of academic excellence is a complex process involving all members and levelsfor all programmes and services offered by National College of Ireland (NCI). These must bear comparison to the best available, both nationally and internationally, and this handbook sets out processes and procedures to ensure that best practice and highest standards are</p><p>The College's determination to deliver fully on the contract that exists between it and its learner body is the main thrust in the development and implementation of academic quality assurance procedures. It is recognised that this can only be achieved through the awareness, consent and co- operation of all members of the College acting in partnership towards a common goal. It also requires the support and encouragement of external bodies such as government agencies, semi- state agencies, business and the wider community.</p><p>All members of the College are invited to recommend improvements in the policy and practice arising from their experience. They can do so at official interaction with the sub- committees of Academic Council; by informing their line manager, who will forward recommendation to the Director of Quality Assurance and Statistical Services; or by writing directly to the Director of Quality Assurance and Statistical Services.</p><p>1.2 Context</p><p>NCI is primarily a teaching institution but has a growing research profile. It provides programmes from Level 6 to Level 10 of the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) as well as programmes from awarding bodies such as the Chartered Institute of Personnel Development (CIPD) and Institute of Commercial Management (ICM). Its academic programmes are validated by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) and have professional recognition by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), the Teaching Council of Ireland, the Psychological Society of Ireland (PSI) and a number of professional accountancy bodies.</p><p>NCI offers programmes on a full and part- time basis, using traditional face- to- face, blended and online delivery. Programmes are delivered at its main campus in the IFSC (Dublin) or at approved off- campus or in- company locations. NCI has a long tradition of providing employer- led education and training, and continues to collaborate with employers through a variety of means, including the provision of statutory apprenticeships. The College has also recently signed a Memorandum of Association with Maynooth University to provide Masters and PhD programmes by research that will be awarded by MU.</p><p>1.3 NCI Principles of Quality Assurance & Enhancement</p><p>NCI is committed to a quality assurance and enhancement system (QAES) that is appropriate to the functions, structures and size of the organisation. In developing and documenting the</p><p>These principles are consistent with the context in which NCI works and references the quality assurance principles of QQI and of the European Standards and Guidelines. In doing so, the QAES:</p><p>Is informed by and is consistent with NCI's mission, values, strategy and resource model.</p><p>Strives for continuous improvement though documentation, planning, monitoring, evaluation and action</p><p>is cognisant of national and international standards and best practice</p><p>is compliant with legislation and policies & guidelines of its awarding and accreditation bodies</p><p>Values inclusivity, diversity, collegiality, accountability and transparency</p><p>1.3.1 NCI Mission & Values</p><p>In supporting NCI’s mission ‘to change lives through education’, the QAES is reflective of he vison and values of the College.</p><p>Vision</p><p>NCI will provide an inspiring educational experience that is innovative, responsive and enterprise focused.</p><p>Values</p><p>Inclusivity - we strive to break down barriers in third- level education; we value diversity and inclusiveness in all that we do; we provide the support that people need to participate fully in life at NCI</p><p>Community - we are an interdependent learning community that shares a common set of principles where individuality and freedom of thought and expression are valued; each of us is encouraged to fulfil our ambition and realise our potential</p><p>Integrity - in our individual and collective roles, we take responsibility and are accountable for our actions; we demonstrate respect and mutual regard for each other</p><p>Dynamic - we are responsive to the needs of our students, colleagues and partners and an ever- changing society; we act in an innovative and flexible manner</p><p>Learner Centred - we place the learner at the heart of everything we do; our combined energies are focused on their individual and collective, life- long needs</p><p>Excellence - as an institution, we aspire to professional excellence in everything we do; we foster excellence in our learners through their learning experiences</p><p>1.3.2 Continuous Improvement</p><p>The QAES strives to be enhancement- led and to use the outputs of its processes to provide action plans for programme committees, schools and services to maintain excellent standards and, where relevant, improve existing practice. In documenting and publishing the system, users are guided through the agreed policy and the authorised processes to be used.</p><p>The QAES assists the overall planning processes of the College, highlighting areas of new programme and service development, and the resources required to implement them and to maintain those already in place. By monitoring existing activity, the system can also identify issues that can be remediated quickly and highlight areas of good practice for sharing across programmes and services. These can in turn be further developed through evaluation for medium and longer term development.</p><p>1.3.3 Cognisant of National and International Standards and Best Practice</p><p>The College recognises that it takes its place in a global education environment and looks to safeguard its reputation, and that of the Irish education sector, through the implementation of the recommendations and guidelines of its stakeholder groups.</p><p>The QAES is used to inform policy and practice through representation on national groups, attendance at seminars, conferences and benchmarking through programme and service development and evaluation.</p><p>1.3.4 Compliant with Legislation, Policies & Guidelines of its awarding and accreditation policies</p><p>As a provider of education and an employer, NCI ensures that all policy and activities are drafted and implemented in accordance with the current legislation in which it operates. This includes but is not limited to employment legislation, equality legislation, data protection legislation, education legislation.</p><p>The QAES is continually reviewed and updated based on published guidelines and policies of its awarding and accrediting bodies. As a provider coming voluntarily to QQI and due to the</p><p>QAES takes its reference from the following QQI policy and guidelines:</p><p>Statutory Quality Assurance Guidelines</p><p>Sector-Specific Quality Assurance Guidelines forIndependent/PrivateProviders</p><p>Topic-Specific Statutory QualityAssurance Guidelines for Providers of StatutoryApprenticeship Programmes</p><p>Topic-Specific Quality Assurance Guidelines for Providers of Research DegreeProgrammes</p><p>Topic Specific Quality Assurance Guidelines for Blended Learning</p><p>Policy for Collaborative Programmes, Transnational Programmes and Joint Awards</p><p>Required Procedures for Access, Transfer and Progression of Learners</p><p>The following sectoral documents were also consulted: Provision of Education to International Students: Code of Practice and Guidelines for Irish Higher Education Institutions (IHEQN), Association for Higher Education Access & Disability (AHEAD) and Disability Advisors Working Network (DAWN).</p><p>1.3.5 Adherence to College Values</p><p>NCI’s quality assurance and enhancement activities are underpinned by the principles of consultation, accountability and transparency. The College values the contribution of its learners to policy and practice and has committed to the principles of student engagement in its quality- related activities. Diversity of opinion is also welcomed so that existing policy and processes are challenged to mitigate against complacency or group- think.</p><p>NCI values a culture of self /open disclosure where adherence to policy or procedure has not been complied with. This allows the open evaluation of the reasons for non- compliance which may have arisen through poor communication, gaps in training or a flaw in the policy or procedure itself. NCI also commits to the publication of the outcomes of its quality assurance and enhancement activities on its website and, where relevant, QQI's.</p><p>NCI will publish the outcomes of its quality assurance activities in the spirit of openness and transparency and to underpin public confidence in its activities.</p><p>1.4 Responsibility for quality assurance</p><p>NCI recognises its responsibility for its internal quality assurance and provision of services and programmes of learning. Effective quality assurance is an institution- wide responsibility. However, the Director of Quality Assurance and Statistical Services (DQASS) has specific responsibility for ensuring that the policies and procedures are effective at all times. The DQASS will ensure that a culture of continuous improvement is fostered within the College and that College managers are complying with the standards as laid down in the QAES.</p><p>The DQASS reports to the Vice President Academic Affairs & Research (VP) and has the authority to report Quality Assurance related issues directly to the President of the College. The responsibility for ensuring the quality management of the academic processes in accordance with NCI policy lies with the Deans of School, Heads of Function and programme committees of the college. Individual members of staff/faculty are required to co- operate with these quality management procedures within the academic structures.</p><p>1.5 Governing Body Statement of Quality Service Standards</p><p>NCI will publish and update a detailed Quality Assurance Manual that states the nature and quality of service which the public can expect, and will publish the same on the website.</p><p>1.5.1 The Learner's Charter</p><p>A detailed commitment by the College and all its learners on quality learning as follows;</p><p>The National College of Ireland Will</p><p>The Learner will</p><p>Provide quality education at a time and place that the learner.</p><p>Take charge of their own learning and produce work to the best of their ability.</p><p>Provide a learning environment and</p><p>Participate actively in all learning</p><p>The National College of Ireland Will</p><p>The Learner will</p><p>resources that support and stimulates the learner and enables them to realise their full potential.</p><p>activities.</p><p>Provide an environment that promotes continuous improvement.</p><p>Ensure a minimum attendance rate of 70% at all lectures, tutorials and class work.</p><p>Provide the learner with programmes of the highest academic quality.</p><p>Make effective use of the facilities and resources provided and plan their use of resources in a responsible and considerate way.</p><p>Provide the learner with accurate information about all programmes and expectations.</p><p>Comply with assessment regulations and use assessment feedback to inform their continued learning.</p><p>Provide an assessment of learning that is fair, valid and timely.</p><p>Participate in programme- related committees and reviews through their learner representative network and provide honest and constructive feedback within the opportunities provided.</p><p>Provide the learner with the opportunity to evaluate their programme and constituent teaching activities in confidence.</p><p>Support and respect the rights of fellow learners, faculty and staff.</p><p>Provide the learner with skilled, qualified supportive staff who will treat you with dignity and respect and be responsive to your learning needs and concerns.</p><p>Abide by all College rules regulations.</p><p>Provide a fair and consistent enforcement of all College rules and regulations.</p><p>Identify problems or concerns they may have and address them to the appropriate people in a timely and constructive manner.</p><p>Provide the learner with a healthy and safe environment that promotes a positive learning experience.</p><p>Treat all members of the College community with the dignity and respect.</p><p>1.5.2 Equality/Diversity</p><p>Ensure the rights to equal treatment, established by equality legislation, and to accommodate diversity, so as to contribute to equality for the groups covered by equality legislation on the grounds of gender, marital status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveler Community.</p><p>1.5.3 Access</p><p>Identify and work to eliminate barriers to access to services for people experiencing poverty and social exclusion, and for those facing geographic barriers to services.</p><p>1.5.4 Physical Access</p><p>Provide clean, accessible public offices that ensure privacy, comply with occupational and safety standards and, as part of this, facilitate access for people with disabilities and others with specific needs.</p><p>1.5.5 Information</p><p>NCI will take a proactive approach in providing information that is clear, timely and accurate, is available at all points of contact and meets the requirements of people with specific needs.  Ensure that the potential offered by Information Technology is fully availed of and that the information available on NCI web sites follows the guidelines on web publication.

This handbook, therefore, incorporates the themes of the Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance in the European Higher Education Area (ESG) and, in particular, Assurance, as outlined below. The chapter summaries highlight the main areas addressed by fic guidelines for quality assurance. Due to the complexity and breadth of provision at NCI, these guidelines are dealt with in many areas and are cross referenced appropriately throughout the handbook.</p><p>Chapter 2 documents NCI’s QAES in accordance with QQI’s Core Guidelines 1: Governance and Management of Quality and 2: Documented Approach to Quality Assurance, respectively. The QAES and the responsibilities accordingly assigned to particular internal stakeholders is available to the public and forms part of the strategic management of the College. The internal stakeholders involved in the QAES are identified and their responsibilities within the structure of quality management are clearly outlined. This chapter also explains how QQI satisfies QQI’s Core Guideline 11: Self-Evaluation, Monitoring and Review by providing the terms of reference and responsibilities of the various internal stakeholders and standing committees involved in the self- evaluation and critical review of programmes in the College and outlines the specific role of the Quality Assurance Office in this regard.</p><p>Chapter 3 outlines the procedures through which NCI proposes, develops and reviews academic programmes in accordance with , specifically 3.1 Programme Development and Approval and 3.3 Programme Monitoring and Review. Accordingly, NCI programmes, and their teaching, learning and assessment strategies, are designed to ensure that learners achieve specific intended learning outcomes. The qualification resulting from a programme is clearly specified and communicated, and corresponds with the correct level and associated standards of the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) for Higher Education and, consequently, to the Qualifications Framework for European Higher Education Area (QF- EHEA). This chapter also outlines NCI’s procedures for Collaborative & Transnational Provision in accordance with Core Guideline 10 Other Parties Involved in Education & Training.</p><p>Chapter 4 includes the policies and associated procedures for the administration of assessments on NCI programmes, demonstrating compliance with QQI’s Core Guideline 6: Assessment of Learners. These policies and procedure are also informed by QQI’s Assessment and Standards (2013) to ensure that learners achievement of intended learning outcomes are fairly and consistently assessed according to the principles outlined therein.</p><p>Chapter 5 explains NCI’s approach to teaching, learning and the student experience, outlining the College’s startagy for enhancing the quality of its provisions in these areas. QQI’s Core Guideline 5: Teaching and Learning is at the core of NCI’s initiatives to ensure that its learning community is informed by best practices and has access to environments and resources most conducive to enhancing the learning experience and the attainment by learners of a programme’s intended learning outcomes.</p><p>Chapter 6 also outlines NCI’s compliance with QQI Core Guideline 3, specifically 3.2: Learner Admission, Progression and Recognition. Information regarding progression and certification is further supplemented by Chapter 4. NCI’s policies and procedures are pre-defined and cover all phases of the student ‘life cycle’, from admission, progression to completion and certification.</p><p>Chapter 7 explains the various services provided to students by NCI and indicates compliance with QQI Guideline 7: Supports for Learners. NCI’s commitment to supporting a diverse student body means that a wide range of services must be provided equitably. In addition, student engagement is particularly important as it allows the College to involve learners in assessing the delivery of their programmes and their teaching, learning and assessment strategies, with the aim of ensuring that all programmes meet their requirements and involving them as partners in their own education.</p><p>Chapter 8 documents the policies informing NCI’s Human Resources strategy and explains how the College adheres to QQI’s Core Guideline 4: Staff recruitment, Management and Development. NCI’s commitment to recruiting the most competent staff is outlined here, in addition to the professional development and progression opportunities to ensure that the most competent staff are retained in the long- term to the benefit of the College and its learners.</p><p>Chapter 9 identifies the legislation that applies to NCI’s information governance procedures, thus indicating the College’s compliance with QQI Core Guideline 8: Information and Data Management. The occasions when the collection, storage and analysis of data, and the individuals associated with these activities, are included here.</p><p>Chapter 10 explains the role of the Marketing and Student Recruitment Department as it complies with QQI’s Core Guideline 9: Public Information and Communication. The policies and associated procedures for ensuring that programme information for both prospective and current students are clearly outlined, in addition to the responsibilities for involved in communicating about or on behalf of NCI.</p><p>Chapters 11, 12 and 13 deal with specialist areas of NCI’s education provisions, Research, Apprenticeships and Blended Learning, respectively. The policies and associated procedures outlined in these chapters are informed by the Topic Specific Guidelines issued by QQI in each of these three areas.</p>"}
