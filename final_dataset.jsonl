{"input": "SUSI FAQs", "output": "<p>What is SUSI?</p>\n<p>Student Universal Support Ireland, or SUSI for short, is Ireland’s national awarding authority for further and higher education grants. They offer funding to eligible students in approved courses at PLC, undergraduate, and postgraduate levels.</p>\n<p>This funding is awarded in line with the Student Support Act 2011, the Student Grant Scheme, and Student Support Regulations. All decisions about applications are made entirely by SUSI; NCI does not have any input into the grant decision process.</p>\n<p>Am I eligible for a SUSI grant?</p>\n<p>SUSI grants are open to EU, EEA, UK, and Swiss nationals, to students with specific immigration status, or those who have leave to remain permission from the Department of Justice. You must have been resident in the Irish State, the EU, EEA, UK or Swiss Federation for three of the last five years. You must also be studying on one of the approved courses and must be progressing in your education: SUSI will only award funding for contribution or contribution and maintenance for one course per NFQ level.</p>\n<p>For more details, please see SUSI’s website, susi.ie. You can also check if you are eligible for a grant, check out the eligibility indicator on their website.</p>\n<p>How do I apply for a SUSI grant?</p>\n<p>Applications are made online at susi.ie</p>\n<p>Once applications open, you are advised to apply as soon as possible as SUSI receive a high number of applications - you do not need to have your Leaving Certificate results or to have accepted a course in order to apply. You will need to update your course and college details on your SUSI account once you have accepted an offer to finalise your application.</p>\n<p>I was awarded a grant and SUSI say that they need to confirm that I am registered at NCI, what does that mean?</p>\n<p>Students can only receive SUSI funding once they are fully registered. In order to be registered as a student in NCI, you need to complete the registration process through your MyDetails account, which includes paying the mandatory €80 gym fee if you are a full-time undergraduate. Once this is done, the Fees team will confirm with SUSI on your behalf, that you have been registered; you do not need to send SUSI a letter confirming your registration status at NCI.</p>\n<p>How do I send a copy of my SUSI letter to the Fees team to show that I am receiving a SUSI grant?</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the details on your letter are correct and then send a copy of the letter to fees@ncirl.ie.</p>\n<p>We ask that you do this as soon as possible so that your fee details can be updated.</p>\n<p>I have changed my course and/or 3rd level institution since I applied for SUSI, is there anything I need to do?</p>\n<p>Yes. If your application for a grant listed a course in a different 3rd level institution or a different course in NCI, you need to update your details on the SUSI website. You can do this by submitting an online Course Change Notification form in the “My Courses” section of your student portal on the SUSI website.</p>\n<p>My application to SUSI was denied, what can I do next?</p>\n<p>You can appeal your grant decision on the SUSI website if you are unhappy that it was denied. SUSI introduced a student contribution grant of €500 which you may be able to receive if you were not deemed eligible for the 50% or 100% grants and/or maintenance. Appeals must be made within 30 days of the original grant decision.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the Appeals page of the SUSI website.</p>\n<p>I received a SUSI grant last academic year; do I need to re-apply?</p>\n<p>Yes. All students progressing to the next level of their course need to renew their application to SUSI to be considered for funding for the next academic year. If you do not do this, it may result in you not receiving any funding for the following year. To renew your application, please check your email account for an offer from SUSI to re-apply and follow their instructions.</p>\n<p>What happens if I want to defer my place or withdraw from my course?</p>\n<p>If you wish to defer your place or if decide that you do not want to attend your course, you will need to cancel your SUSI application in the “My Requests” section of their student portal. Failure to do so could affect future SUSI funding applications.</p>\n<p>I am going to be a part-time student, can I apply for SUSI?</p>\n<p>SUSI grants for part-time students are only available for approved courses in specific institutions. Unfortunately, part-time students in NCI are not currently eligible for this funding.</p>\n<p>I have to repeat a year, can I still apply for a SUSI grant?</p>\n<p>Repeat students are generally only eligible for SUSI funding under exceptional circumstances.</p>\n<p>My course isn’t part of the Free Fees Scheme, can I still apply for a SUSI grant?</p>\n<p>Yes. Fee grants are available to students whose courses are not included in the Free Fees Scheme.</p>\n<p>I have a disability; can SUSI offer any extra help with my application?</p>\n<p>Yes. SUSI have an Access Officer who can give additional guidance and assistance to people with disabilities, and an Irish Sign Language interpreter service if you are a member of the Deaf community. You can send an email to access.officer@susi.ie for more information.</p>\n<p>How do I get in touch with SUSI?</p>\n<p>There is a SUSI Support Desk which is open from Monday to Friday (09:00 – 17:30), excluding public holidays.</p>\n<p>You can contact them by emailing support@susi.ie or by phoning them on:</p>\n<p>0818 888 777 (if calling from Ireland) or on +353 1 524 2257 (if calling from another country).</p>\n<p>To learn more about this topic, please read the following article: <a href=\"http://localhost:5001/articles/susi-faqs-national-college-of-ireland\" target=\"_blank\">SUSI FAQs – National College of Ireland</a></p>\n<p><hr></p>\n<p>"}

Also, students who have deferred and are not currently studying in the college are not eligible.</p>\n<p>How do I register with the Counselling and Wellness Service?</p>\n<p>After you have sent an email from your NCI student email account, a team member will send you forms you need to fill out, a registration form and a consent form, before you can be registered with the service. Once you have returned those, there will be a short waiting period, after which one of the counsellors will contact you (via email) to organise your first session.</p>\n<p>What topics can I talk to the counsellors about?</p>\n<p>Any issue that is causing you difficulties and which might include:</p>\n<p>Stress</p>\n<p>Anxiety</p>\n<p>Academic difficulties</p>\n<p>Relationship difficulties</p>\n<p>Depression</p>\n<p>Family issues</p>\n<p>Grief or bereavement</p>\n<p>Homesickness/loneliness</p>\n<p>Sexual/personal identity issues</p>\n<p>Physical assault/abuse</p>\n<p>Self-harm</p>\n<p>Disordered eating</p>\n<p>Addiction or substance use</p>\n<p>Confidence or self-esteem issues</p>\n<p>LGBTQ+ Support</p>\n<p>Autism/ADHD Support</p>\n<p>Do I have to pay for the sessions?</p>\n<p>No, the counselling sessions offered to students are free, so you do not need to pay anything.</p>\n<p>How do I get in touch with the Counselling and Wellness Service?</p>\n<p>Send an email to counselling@ncirl.ie from your NCI student email address. Due to Counselling and Wellness Service policies, we cannot engage with students who contact us from an external email address.</p>\n<p>How many counselling sessions can I attend?</p>\n<p>The service is designed to be brief, with an average of 4-6 sessions per year. Your counsellor will determine the number of sessions based on your needs. For longer-term counselling, we can refer you to external providers.</p>\n<p>How long is each counselling session?</p>\n<p>Sessions last 50 minutes.</p>\n<p>How often are the meetings?</p>\n<p>This depends on your individual needs, but they usually happen on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.</p>\n<p>Where do the sessions take place?</p>\n<p>We offer in-person, audio, and online sessions. In-person sessions occur in the main NCI campus building at Mayor’s Square. Online sessions are held through Microsoft Teams, and audio sessions happen via phone calls; we recommend that you find a quiet and more private space for these.</p>\n<p>When do the sessions take place?</p>\n<p>Sessions are offered throughout the year, including the summer months (during Semester 3). They take place between 09:30 and 16:30.</p>\n<p>Is it confidential?</p>\n<p>Yes. We provide a professional and confidential service, with all staff adhering to a strict code of practice and ethics. The relationship between a student and a counsellor is confidential, meaning anything you share with your counsellor stays within the Counselling Service. However, should your counsellor believe that you are at immediate risk of harming yourself or others, they may need to break confidentiality. Also, if there is a concern about a child being at risk, the Service must report this to Tusla or the Garda Síochána as per national child protection policies. In such cases, your counsellor will make every effort to discuss the situation with you and involve you in the disclosure process.</p>\n<p>Is it inclusive?</p>\n<p>Yes! NCI’s Student Counselling and Wellness Service recognises, acknowledges, and appreciates the dignity and diversity of all students who use our services. Our staff are dedicated to providing an inclusive service, striving to meet the unique needs of each student regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, religion, socioeconomic status, disability, ethnicity, culture, or membership of the Traveller community.</p>\n<p>What if I have to cancel or reschedule an appointment?</p>\n<p>If you need to cancel or reschedule, please give us as much notice as possible so we can offer the appointment to another student. Please email your counsellor or counselling@ncirl.ie to inform us of any changes.</p>\n<p>What if I decide that counselling is not for me?</p>\n<p>You are not required to attend further appointments if you choose not to. Students often attend only one session. If you wish to cancel your next appointment, please give us as much notice as possible so we can offer the slot to another student.</p>\n<p>Where are my records kept, and for how long?</p>\n<p>Counsellors must keep records of all sessions. These files are securely stored for seven years and then destroyed. If you wish to access your file, you can ask your counsellor or make a formal request to the University Freedom of Information Officer.</p>\n<p>I am a student with mobility concerns. Can I still attend the service?</p>\n<p>Yes, absolutely. When reserving your initial session, please email counselling@ncirl.ie in advance or mention your accessibility needs in the registration form. We will ensure your needs are met. NCI’s Student Counselling and Wellness Service premises are wheelchair accessible.</p>\n<p>What does it mean if the Counselling and Wellness Service has a waiting list?</p>\n<p>The Service will use a waiting list during busy periods with high demand for counselling sessions. This list is organised according to the date students contacted the service. If the waiting list is in place when you request counselling sessions, you will be informed of the approximate waiting time length: due to the nature of counselling sessions and individual needs, we cannot give exact timelines. You will also be offered a free mental health-based appointment with Hanover Medical; this is not a counselling session.</p>\n<p>When your name reaches the top of the list, a team member will contact you and ask you to complete the forms as usual. Once these are returned, you will be given an updated approximate waiting time, after which you will be contacted about arranging your first session.</p>\n<p>Are there any other mental health resources I can make use of?</p>\n<p>Here are some mental health resources you can access through NCI:</p>\n<p>Online mental health platform SilverCloud with self-guided programmes on various topics such as stress, anxiety, depression, body image, resilience, mindfulness, and sleep.

Equity considers the presence of privilege as well as the presence of restricted opportunity. This may include positive action measures (defined below) in order to pursue greater equality of outcome.</p>\n<p>Diversity: understanding, appreciating and embracing differences and practicing mutual respect for qualities and experiences that are different from the majority.</p>\n<p>Inclusion: is a sense of belonging; feeling respected and valued; feeling a level of support and commitment from others so that one can achieve their best at work and study.</p>\n<p>Equality Grounds:</p>\n<p>The following nine protected grounds are defined under the Employment Equality Acts 2015</p>\n<p>Gender – a person’s identity as male or female (including transgender persons). A person may identify away from a binary gender identity.</p>\n<p>Civil Status – single, married, separated, divorced, widowed, in a civil partnership or being a former civil partner.</p>\n<p>Family Status – responsibility as a parent or as a person in loco parentis in relation to a person under 18, or as a parent or the resident primary carer of a person over 18 with a disability.</p>\n<p>Sexual Orientation – including but not limited to Heterosexual, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual or Asexual.</p>\n<p>Disability - temporary or permanent conditions impacting the physical, mental or emotional functioning of a person, including a range of medical conditions, learning, intellectual and cognitive disabilities.</p>\n<p>Race– including Race, Colour, Nationality, or Ethnic or National Origins.</p>\n<p>Religious Belief – including different religious affiliations as well as absence of religious beliefs.</p>\n<p>Member of the Traveller Community – referring to the community of people who are commonly called Travellers and who are identified (both by themselves and others) as people with a shared history, culture and traditions including, historically, a nomadic way of life on the island of Ireland.</p>\n<p>Age</p>\n<p>Socio-economic-status: a combined economic and sociological measure economic and social position in relation to others, based on the income, education, and occupation of an individual and their family. *Discrimination based on class or socio-economic status is included in the Irish constitution.</p>\n<p>EDI mainstreaming: ensures that the principle of Equality, Diversity and Inclusion, along with the protection of all human rights are embedded and mainstreamed into every aspect of college life. This includes a requirement to assess the impact of policies, procedures, practices and communications in furthering the principles of equality, diversity, inclusion and fairness.</p>\n<p>Universal Design: ensures the design and composition of an environment so that it may be accessed, understood and used to the greatest possible extent in the most independent and natural manner possible in the widest possible range of situations without the need for adaptation, modification, assistive devices or specialised solutions, by any persons of any age or size or having any particular physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual ability or disability. This definition incorporates the principles of Universal Design in Learning in designing educational opportunities throughout the College.</p>\n<p>EDI data monitoring: processes around collection, analysing, storing and reporting on equality grounds within the broad College community.</p>\n<p>Legislative compliance: ensuring that the College will apply this policy in compliance with and in the spirit of all relevant legislation.</p>\n<p>Positive Action: defined by the Employment Equality Act as measures maintained or newly adopted with a view to ensuring full equality in practice to mitigate the impact or potential impact of disadvantage linked to any of the nine equality grounds.</p>\n<p>Bias: refers to one’s background, personal experiences, societal stereotypes and cultural context which can have an impact on decisions and actions. This can be either conscious or unconscious. Unconscious or implicit bias happens by our brains making incredibly quick judgments and assessments of people and situations using these biases.</p>\n<p>Discrimination: treatment or potential treatment that is less favourable based on the nine equality grounds or socio-economic status. This includes direct and indirect discrimination.</p>\n<p>Direct Discrimination: occurs when one person is treated less favourably than someone else due to one or more of the nine equality grounds.</p>\n<p>Indirect Discrimination: occurs when an apparently neutral practice or policy puts someone belonging to one or more of the nine equality grounds at a disadvantage in comparison to someone else. This includes when there is a practice or policy that has a worse effect on certain groups or individuals.</p>\n<p>Discrimination by Association: where a person is treated less favourably due to an association with someone belonging to one or more of the nine equality grounds.</p>\n<p>Discrimination by Imputation: when a person is treated less favourably due to being labelled as belonging to one or more of the nine equality grounds.</p>\n<p><ul></p>\n<p><li>Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy</li></p>\n<p></ul></p>\n<p>The National College of Ireland is committed to changing lives through education and values inclusion in education, research which enriches our society and opportunities based on equity and fairness.</p>\n<p>The College values the enrichment that comes from a diverse community of students and staff and is committed to preventing opportunity for discrimination in the access, experience, progression and achievement of all students and staff through developing and implementing fair and transparent policies and practices.</p>\n<p>This Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy has been developed to provide a framework for the College to meet its obligations as an equal opportunities employer and public service provider.</p>\n<p><ul></p>\n<p><li>Aims</li></p>\n<p></ul></p>\n<p>The promotion of equality and respect of all human rights is integral to the overall purpose of the National College of Ireland, where we commit to working together as educators, researchers, administrative, professional and technical staff along with students in a diverse scholarly community</p>\n<p>The National College of Ireland Equality and Diversity Policy seeks to:</p>\n<p>promote a culture of excellence through mainstreaming the principles of equality, diversity and inclusion into all College activities, policies and planning;</p>\n<p>promote equality and ensure non-discrimination for all staff in relation to all aspects of employment;</p>\n<p>take positive action where appropriate to assist in advancing equality in employment and College activities to address under-representation;</p>\n<p>promote equality in education for all students across the education cycle, providing an excellent education for all, and enabling all students to maximise their potential;

There may be occasions where contact occurs, including for example where business and operational reasons require contact outside of normal working hours and depending on the nature of an employee’s role. This however should be rare and not the norm.</p>\n<p>The health, safety, and well-being of our employees are of the utmost importance to us NCI and we encourage and support you to prioritise your wellbeing. Disconnecting from work and work devices is vital for your well-being, and to help you achieve a healthy and sustainable work-life balance.</p>\n<p>To encourage and support our employees in balancing their working and personal lives, whether they work standard hours in the workplace, work remotely or flexibly, or work shifts we have developed a Right to Disconnect policy, which includes best practice guidance around working hours, the use of technology and more.</p>\n<p><ul></p>\n<p><li>Legislative Basis</li></p>\n<p></ul></p>\n<p>Section 20(2) of the Workplace Relations Act, 2015 provides, at the request of the Minister, the preparation of draft codes of practice by the WRC (Workplace Relations Commission) for submission to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade, and Employment.</p>\n<p>The Code of Practice for Employers and Employees on the Right to Disconnect sets out guidelines and best practices for employers and employees.  The code of practice was agreed upon through public consultation. The thirty-seven submissions received were fully considered in the development of the Code. In finalising the Code, the WRC engaged with representatives of employers and employees including IBEC (Irish Business and Employers Confederation) and ICTU (Irish Congress for Trade Unions). This code of practice underpins NCI’s Right to Disconnect Policy.</p>\n<p>Other legislation relevant to this policy includes:</p>\n<p>Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997</p>\n<p>This act does not explicitly refer to a “right to disconnect” but it does state that employers cannot permit employees to work more than a maximum of 48 hours in any one week, except in very limited circumstances. It also states that employers must keep records of hours worked and ensure that staff receive rest breaks each day as well as rest days (e.g. weekend days or other assigned days off).</p>\n<p>The Safety and Welfare at Work Act, 2005</p>\n<p>This act sets out the responsibilities of employers and employees about Health and Safety at work.</p>\n<p>The Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994-2014</p>\n<p>The purpose of the Act is to implement an EU Directive which requires employers to provide a written statement to employees setting out particulars of the employee’s terms of employment. The Act also repeals sections 9 and 10 of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973 as those sections are overtaken by the provisions of this Act.</p>\n<p><ul></p>\n<p><li>Role of the College, Managers, and Employees</li></p>\n<p></ul></p>\n<p>All employees have an active role to play in communication management and the reduction of unnecessary business communications outside normal working hours.</p>\n<p>The College encourages the ongoing cultivation of a culture where our employees feel they can disconnect from work and work-related devices and this necessitates a joint approach by the College, our managers, and employees.</p>\n<p>Some of the respective obligations include:</p>\n<p>The role of the College:</p>\n<p>To provide information to employees on their working time, by the relevant legislation (contract).</p>\n<p>To ensure a safe workplace, in line with the health and safety legislation.</p>\n<p>To not penalise an employee for acting in compliance with any relevant provision of the health and safety legislation.</p>\n<p>The role of the employee:</p>\n<p>To ensure that they manage their own working time and take care to protect their safety, health and welfare, and the health and safety of co-workers, in line with the health and safety legislation and seek support in doing so if necessary.</p>\n<p>To cooperate fully with any appropriate mechanism utilised by the College to record working time, including when working remotely.</p>\n<p>To respect the working time of colleagues and other contacts (including periods of leave).</p>\n<p>The role of the manager:</p>\n<p>Managers in particular play a central role in the successful implementation of this policy and have a duty to respect their team members’ right to disconnect and should provide a good example for their team.</p>\n<p><ul></p>\n<p><li>Working Hours</li></p>\n<p></ul></p>\n<p>The College’s ‘normal working hours’ are clearly set out in each staff members individual contract of employment. Managers must be aware of these different work patterns and hours pertaining to each staff member reporting to them.</p>\n<p>There are legitimate reasons where a staff member may be contacted out of hours e.g. a serious data breach where technology needs to be powered down, in the event of a death, where there is something stipulated within the contract of employment whereby contact outside of hours maybe required from time to time.</p>\n<p>Ensure to block out time in your diary to hold time for your breaks.</p>\n<p><ul></p>\n<p><li>Communications</li></p>\n<p></ul></p>\n<p>We use a range of communication methods in the course of our work. Try and ensure good practice for your own and your colleagues working time in each area.</p>\n<p>Electronic & Phone Communications</p>\n<p>The College respects your personal time and expects you to disconnect from work e-mails and work communications outside of normal working hours.</p>\n<p>It is acknowledged that the working “norm” for one may be different for another and due to differing/non-standard patterns of work within the College. Some employees may send communications at times that are opportune for themselves, but inopportune for other employees, e.g. late nights/weekends. These should be sent without any intent to disturb the recipient or in expectation of a speedy answer/response during hours of non-attendance.</p>\n<p>In that event, bear in mind the following:</p>\n<p>Try to only check and send e-mails during normal working hours where possible, but we are also mindful of the requirements of those who wish to work in a more flexible manner.</p>\n<p>The sender should give due consideration to the timing of their communication and potential for disturbance. The recipient should understand that they will not be expected to respond until their working time recommences. If you are sending emails outside the normal hours of the working day, please also consider other people’s working hours:</p>\n<p>Send the e-mail with a signature disclaimer at the end, e.g. “I have sent this email at a time that is convenient for me. I do not expect you to respond to it outside of your usual working hours.”</p>\n<p>Consider drafting the email and sending it during normal working hours or using the ‘delay send’ option and set it to a specified time on the next working day</p>\n<p>Always consider the tone/contents/context of texts and emails and other electronic communications (e.g. instant messaging apps).</p>\n<p>Please ensure that your out-of-office notifications are properly activated when you are out of the office and that your out-of-office message correctly directs the recipient to the appropriate colleague.</p>\n<p>Please respect out-of-office notifications when you receive them from others.</p>\n<p>In the case of an urgent or time-sensitive situation after normal working hours, please consider the need and urgency before sending an email. Consider a phone call as an alternative.</p>\n<p>Where the monitoring of social media channels or platforms are an integral part of your role then staff maybe required to monitor and update information at any time, particularly in the case of emergency communications e.g. adverse weather, pandemic, IT outages.</p>\n<p>Please note that work communications through social media channels or platforms are not encouraged and employees should not feel that they must respond to social communications from colleagues outside of their working hours.</p>\n<p><ul></p>\n<p><li>Meetings</li></p>\n<p></ul></p>\n<p>While meetings can be crucial to strengthen connections between individuals and teams, individual teams and managers are encouraged to review the frequency and timing of meetings they hold to ensure optimum use of time and allow colleagues time to work outside of meetings.</p>\n<p>Avoid scheduling meetings outside of our core hours or during lunch hours, unless absolutely necessary.</p>\n<p>Respect people's time by only inviting them to meetings where their presence is necessary.</p>\n<p>Share and adopt best practice for meetings, for example ensure there is a clear agenda with relevant material shared in advance, with actions recorded and shared post meetings.</p>\n<p><ul></p>\n<p><li>Wellbeing</li></p>\n<p></ul></p>\n<p>Employees, including those engaging in flexible working arrangements or remote working, are reminded to switch off from work and work devices outside their normal working hours and while on leave.</p>\n<p>Employees are encouraged to familiarise themselves with their break entitlements as set out in their contracts and ensure that they are availing of these.

{"input": "Code of Practice for Academic Honesty and Integrity", "output": "<p>Introduction</p>\n<p>The following guide outlines the definition, types, process and outcomes of an issue of Academic Misconduct. For queries relating the this guide, please contact registrarsoffice@ncirl.ie</p>\n<p>Quick Start Guide For Students</p>\n<p>Although full details are fleshed out in the article below, this section provides a high level overview of the process for a student who has been referred for a suspected case of Academic Misconduct.</p>\n<p>The lecturer will invite the student to meet.</p>\n<p>If suspicions are confirmed or remain; the lecturer will seek a second opinion of a qualified staff member.</p>\n<p>If second opinion agrees; the lecturer refers the student through the Academic Integrity Form to the Registrar's office.</p>\n<p>The Registrar's office and lecturer will agree a provisonal sanction, which will be emailed to the student. The student may then:</p>\n<p>A) If sanction is at levels 1-3 the learner has the opportunity to 'reject' the sanction and request a hearing of the Academic Integrity Panel.</p>\n<p>B) Accept the sanction. The Lecturer who referred the student will confirm the next steps and resubmission details.</p>\n<p>C) If the sanction is deemed to be at Level 4, or the student is in award year, the student must attend an Academic Integrity Panel hearing who will speak with the student and decide an appropriate action.</p>\n<p>The decision of the Academic Integrity Panel will decide the ultimate sanction for cases at L4 or Award Year. The student may still appeal this decision to the Appeals Committee.</p>\n<p>Suspected Incidents of Academic Misconduct</p>\n<p>Any behaviour or action which contravenes academic integrity and breaches its fundamental values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility, and courage is considered to constitute Academic Misconduct.</p>\n<p>NCI reserves the right to avail of any technological or other means available to it to detect suspected occurrence(s) of plagiarism or any other act of academic misconduct in respect of any assessment or other academic activity undertaken by any of its learners.</p>\n<p>When a suspected incidence of academic misconduct occurs during an examination setting, it will be addressed in accordance with the College’s Examinations and Assessment Regulations.</p>\n<p>Where a suspected incidence of academic misconduct by any learner other than in an examination occurs, it will be investigated in accordance with the provisions of the Academic Integrity Policy.</p>\n<p>Where a suspected incidence of academic misconduct comes to the attention of any member of the College’s staff, they are required to notify the relevant authority such as the Programme/ Course Director, Lecturer or equivalent in the School in which the learner is enrolled.  Following an assessment of the suspected breach by the appropriate subject matter expert(s), the relevant Lecturer, School or Unit will refer the case via the Academic Integrity Form, which will calculate and classify the response/sanction (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, or Level 4) for the suspected breach in accordance with the criteria provided.</p>\n<p>A note on AI/Plagiarism</p>\n<p>Please note that the use of AI is not in and of itself academic misconduct. Depending on how/why AI is used in a student assignment, it may be classified under any of the 'Types of Concern' below. For instance if a student uses AI to write an essay without their own significant input into the work, this would be deemed as plagiarism, not a seperate 'AI use' categorisation. Similarly, if a student were to falsify research results/data, this would be classed under the 'Falsification / Fabrication' category below.</p>\n<p>Students must disclose when they use AI, and must be given the opportunity to do so via the Project Cover Sheet which contains a section for referencing AI usage.</p>\n<p>Student guidance for the use of AI in assignments can be found here.</p>\n<p>The college reserves the right for lecturers to ask students to attend a viva to explain their work at any point.</p>\n<p>Response to Academic Misconduct (outcomes & consequence)</p>\n<p>Academic misconduct includes offences such as plagiarism, collusion, falsification, and cheating in any undergraduate or postgraduate assessment or assignment. In cases of suspected academic misconduct, the lecturer responsible for assigning and/or grading the relevant assessment completes the Academic Integrity Form. The form calculates an indicative score according to the suspected severity of the offence. The score determines the recommended consequences.</p>\n<p>In all cases, the lecturer will inform the student of the suspected academic misconduct and invite the student to meet with them. If suspicions of academic misconduct persist after the meeting, or if the student does not attend, the lecturer will seek the opinion of another qualified staff member, and if in agreement that there is academic misconduct, the lecturer will then use the academic integrity form to calculate the level of misconduct and to inform the office of the Registrar.</p>\n<p>If for any reason the lecturer disagrees with the calculated outcome of the Academic Integrity form, they may reject the findings and discuss directly with the Registrar’s office. Likewise, if a student disagrees with the calculated outcome of the Academic Integrity form, they may reject the findings and discuss directly with the Registrar’s office.</p>\n<p>The Schools may instead decide to have learner assignments not considered to be a valid submission; the lecturer may on reading the assignment decide that the learner has not answered the question or used sources not relevant. It is not marked and returned to the learner for resubmission.</p>\n<p>Academic Misconduct/Dishonesty Types</p>\n<p>Behaviours perpetrated by individuals or institutions that transgress ethical standards held in common between other individuals and/ or groups in institutions of education, research or scholarship[1]. Academic misconduct includes offences such as plagiarism, collusion, falsification including inappropriate AI usage and cheating in any undergraduate or postgraduate assessment or assignment.</p>\n<p>In cases of suspected academic misconduct, the lecturer responsible for assigning and/or grading the relevant assessment will first meet with the student, and then complete the Academic Integrity Form. The form calculates an indicative score according to the suspected severity of the offence. The score determines the recommended consequences or ‘sanction’.</p>\n<p>The ‘type of concern’ in the table below is a major step in the calculation of the severity and sanction of the misconduct.</p>\n<p>Type of concern Description</p>\n<p>Basic violations  Include, but are not limited to, submitting a limited portion of the same material more than once without prior authorisation; giving your own academic work to others even when doing so was not explicitly prohibited; attendance/participation points misrepresentation; violation of instructor policies if behaviour not listed elsewhere in the guidelines; poor academic writing skill e.g., poor referencing or the passing off of somebody else's ideas as if originally discovered by the learner, or small errors made through carelessness or misunderstanding</p>\n<p>Limited plagiarism Includes, but is not limited to, presenting work / ideas taken from other sources without proper acknowledgement. Paraphrasing from sources without attribution; verbatim copying from sources without attribution when what was copied was not a critical aspect (key, central ideas) of the assessment and impacted less than 30% of the assessment; plagiarism that includes false citations; looking online for a solution to an assessment and copying part of that solution/answer. Self-plagiarism could also fall into this category.</p>\n<p>Extensive plagiarism Includes, but is not limited to, plagiarism when the aspects copied are critical aspects of the assessment and/or constitute more than 30% of the assessment or impact the integrity of more than 30% of the assessment thus requiring a new assessment; extensively copying from another learner’s assessment without acknowledgment of their contribution;  plagiarism that includes false citations. Mosaic copying/ scaffolding/ substantial similarity: An unoriginal piece of writing composed of acknowledged or unacknowledged extracts from several different sources. Where the key points and structure of another person’s work have been used as a scaffold (framework) for your own work, without acknowledging the source. This is plagiarism. Self-plagiarism that constitutes more than 30% of the assessment would also fall into this category.</p>\n<p>Collusion Undisclosed collaboration between two or more people on an assessment or task, which was supposed to be completed individually when clear information was provided to students. Collusion includes inappropriate or unauthorised collaboration by two or more people in the production and submission of assessment task; learners providing their work to another learner before the submission deadline, or for the purpose of the other learner’s plagiarism at any time. Allowing another (e.g., friend / relative /peer / tutor) to write / translate / significantly edit one's assessment without acknowledging that help.</p>\n<p>Falsification / Fabrication Includes, but is not limited to, altering a graded assessment provided by another person and submitting for re-grade; fabricating data for a lab or research assessment; submitting data you didn't yourself collect; lying/giving a false excuse to miss or receive unfair accommodation on an assessment. Types of major misconduct in an education, research or scholarship setting: Forging educational, research or scholarship content, images, data, equipment or processes so that they are inaccurately represented. Fabrication: Fabrication in the context of research means making up data, experiments, or other significant information in proposing conducting or reporting research.</p>\n<p>Exam Cheating (including online and in class exams) Action or behaviour that violates rules in an attempt to give one learner an unfair advantage over another. Exam cheating includes, but is not limited to, copying from another person or allowing another person to copy during an examination; having an unapproved aid directly related to the exam (e.g., ‘cheat sheets’; course-related notes; textbook; whether electronically or hard copy); having ubiquitous smart technology (e.g., mobile phone, smart watch) accessible during an exam.</p>\n<p>Fraud / Impersonation Actions that are intended to deceive for unfair advantage by violating academic regulations. Using intentional deception to gain academic credit. Fraud includes some of the most egregious violations – e.g. stealing or fraudulently obtaining answers to an assessment prompt/exam before submitting the assessment for grading; changing/helping to change any recorded assessment or course grade on an instructor's or university record; illicitly obtaining an assessment completed by another (without their knowledge) and submitting it (in part or whole) as one's own; submitting fake or false documents (e.g. medical notes)</p>\n<p>Contract Cheating Form of academic misconduct when a person uses an undeclared and/or unauthorised third party, online or directly, to assist them to produce work for academic credit or progression, whether or not payment or other favour is involved. Contract cheating is any behaviour whereby a learner arranges to have another person or entity (‘the provider’) complete (in part or total) an assessment (e.g. exam, test, quiz, assessment, paper, project, problems) for the learner. If the provider is also a student, both students are in violation.</p>\n<p>[1] Academic Integrity: National Principles and Lexicon of Common Terms, (2021) NAIN.

NCI takes learner complaints & grievances seriously and endeavours to improve its processes and services by supporting learners in expressing their dissatisfaction and seeking resolution to problems encountered.</p>\n<p>A complaint \"is an expression of dissatisfaction by one or more members of the public about an organisation’s action or lack of action, or about the standard of service provided by or on behalf of the organisation”.</p>\n<p>A grievance is an informal expression of dissatisfaction.</p>\n<p>To ensure that learners have an appropriate means of lodging formal complaints & informal grievances that cannot be remedied via any other local mechanisms, NCI has developed the following student complaints & grievances procedure.</p>\n<p>NCI’s “Learner Complaints & Grievances Procedure” seeks to provide a system to resolve legitimate complaints in a timely fashion. Such complaints & grievances can relate to the delivery of academic programmes (wide-ranging in scope) and/or the provision/availability of services. Most concerns can be successfully addressed and remedied through informal means, i.e., before a formal complaint is made. However, if informal resolution is unsuccessful or not to the satisfaction of the learner, the formal procedure can be pursued. NCI will follow the College Data Protection policy1 when investigating and retaining information about individuals within formal complaints.</p>\n<p>Complaints & grievances should only be made by the impacted individual, and not by someone else on their behalf, even with their prior consent. The exception to this is whereby a complaint or grievance is shared by multiple learners (Section 5.1.3.1).</p>\n<p>All complaints and grievances will be handled with sensitivity and discretion, and access to information about individual investigations will only be shared with those with a legitimate access requirement. All staff and learners who become aware of any of the issues involved in a formal complaint are required to keep this information confidential, except insofar as is necessary to progress, investigate or respond to the complaint. Data collected as part of a complaint will be treated in accordance with Data Protection legislation and will be retained in keeping with the NCI’s records retention policy. Retaliation or victimisation as a result of a complaint will not be tolerated. Complaints & grievances found to be malicious or vexatious will be dealt with under the College’s disciplinary procedures. NCI takes genuine learner complaints & grievances seriously and supports learners in seeking a resolution to their dissatisfaction. The Learner will not be discriminated against or suffer any recrimination as a result of making a legitimate complaint.</p>\n<p><ul></p>\n<p><li>5.1.1 Scope</li></p>\n<p></ul></p>\n<p>The “Learner Complaints & Grievances Procedure” can be used to submit a complaint about any aspect of NCI’s academic provisions and/or any other service provided directly by the College. The procedure does not, however, cover the following categories, for which separate procedures exist (if you need any more information on these procedures, please visit the appropriate section of this document outlined below:</p>\n<p>Grievances relating to personal harassment or discrimination on the grounds of gender, civil status, family status, age, disability, race, religious belief, sexual orientation or membership of the traveling community (Section Error! Reference source not found.);</p>\n<p>Requests for reviews of academic decisions (Chapter 4: Assessment) ;</p>\n<p>Complaints relating to the Students' Union (Contact president@ncisu.ie); and</p>\n<p>Appeals against decisions taken under disciplinary proceedings (Section Error! Reference source not found.).</p>\n<p>https://www.ncirl.ie/Legal/Privacy#la-7362761-1-introduction</p>\n<p>The “Learner Complaints & Grievances Procedure” is available for learners currently enrolled on an NCI programme. Additionally, any individual who was a registered learner but who has graduated or otherwise left the College may also avail of the procedure providing that any such complaint is made within three months of the individual’s programme finish date and that the acts or omissions being complained have occurred whilst they were a registered learner. The following process is designed to resolve complaints or grievances as speedily and effectively as possible. The starting point is always to encourage the resolution of complaints or grievances through informal means, but the College provides a formal process where this proves unsuccessful or unsatisfactory to the complainant. All complaints, whether formal or informal, will be dealt with respectfully in the context of the College’s policies and according to the resources available.</p>\n<p><ul></p>\n<p><li>5.1.2 Informal Grievance</li></p>\n<p></ul></p>\n<p>To make an informal grievance, the learner should first address concerns directly to the person responsible to attempt to resolve the matter informally or discuss the concern with their Class Representative (If a Class Representative is not available, please contact the Students’ Union (SU)). Alternatively, the learner may ask their programme coordinator to discuss the grievance on their behalf.</p>\n<p>If these options prove unsuccessful or unsatisfactory, the learner should then approach the person responsible for the programme or service unit about which the learner has made the complaint. This may be the learner’s Programme Director or Dean of School, or the relevant Head of Service Unit (All staff members details will be provided in the Learner Handbook and on Moodle). If the Learner needs help in expressing their concern or is reluctant to approach the person(s) responsible for the programme or service/unit, they can seek advice from the SU Welfare or Academic Affairs Officers or the Student Services Team. Contact information can be found here; https://www.ncirl.ie/About/A-Z-Staff-Directory. The learner can also seek advice from the Students’ Union Executive if they are not sure who the appropriate person is.</p>\n<p><ul></p>\n<p><li>5.1.3 Formal Complaint</li></p>\n<p></ul></p>\n<p>If it is not possible to resolve the issue informally, the learner can lodge a formal complaint with the Registrar through the Student Hub. This formal complaint must be submitted by filling in the learner complaint form.</p>\n<p>All formal complaints must be identifiable; therefore, the complaint or grievance cannot be anonymous at the point of submission. All complaints will be handled with sensitivity and discretion, and access to information about individual investigations will only be shared with those with a legitimate access requirement. Access requirements may be denied by the registrar to maintain confidentiality of the learner where appropriate. The College will never seek information from confidential services e.g., counselling & disability, without the consent of the complainant, unless there is a serious risk of harm or danger to the individual, other learners, or staff members. The level of risk will be assessed by the Registrar along with the heads of counselling and disability services.</p>\n<p>All complaints will go to the Registry Office through the Student Hub. As part of the investigation process, the Registrar will inform key individuals including Deans and Heads of Units where appropriate.</p>\n<p><ul></p>\n<p><li>5.1.3.1 Collective Grievances/Complaints</li></p>\n<p></ul></p>\n<p>Where a complaint or grievance is shared by multiple learners, learners can also raise this as a group through the class rep, if a class rep has been elected. If a class rep has not been elected, the collective group or their nominated representative should follow the mechanisms outlined above or contact the Students’ Union (SU). Learners can also choose to raise their concerns as an individual using the steps above.</p>\n<p><ul></p>\n<p><li>5.1.3.2 Acknowledgement of Complaint, Investigation and Response</li></p>\n<p></ul></p>\n<p>The Registrar will appoint a person to lead the investigation and a report from the investigation will inform the decision of the Registrar. The learner can expect to receive a written acknowledgement of their complaint within 48 hours (excluding weekends/bank holidays where the learner would receive an acknowledgement the next working day after the weekend/bank holiday) of its receipt with an estimated investigation and response timeframe of no more than 15 working days. The Learner will be kept updated throughout the investigation phase. They can also expect to be kept informed if there is undue delay in coming to an appropriate resolution. The Learner will also be kept informed of any decisions to refer the complaint to a suitable staff member or to another office for redress, or to pursue and remedy the complaint according to another College procedure.</p>\n<p>The learner’s complaint will be investigated as quickly as possible. The investigation may include individual face-to-face discussions with the complainant and the relevant staff member or head of service. All meetings will be minuted and shared with the complainant. The learner may be accompanied by a Tutor, Student Support officer, SU Officers for Welfare and Academic Affairs, etc. Any staff member can be accompanied by a staff rep of their choice. The Office of the Registrar will set out the structure of the meetings in advance with the Complainant and/or relevant staff member or head of service. Once the investigation has been completed, the complainant will receive a written response detailing the measures taken and what actions, if any, are to be taken. The response will be sent to the complainant from the Registrar. If the complaint is deemed malicious or fake, disciplinary action may be taken (See Section 5.10 Disciplinary Policy & Procedures). The Learner will not be discriminated or suffer any recrimination as a result of making a legitimate complaint.</p>\n<p><ul></p>\n<p><li>5.1.3.3 Appeals</li></p>\n<p></ul></p>\n<p>If the complainant is not satisfied with the decision of the Registrar, they can appeal by submitting the Appeals form on the Student Hub directly to the Office of the President.</p>\n<p>Grounds for an appeal:</p>\n<p>The Learner has the right to appeal the decision of the Registrar if they feel that the response did not adequately address the areas of the complaint or if there was a procedural irregularity during the investigation.</p>\n<p>The President or the Vice-President would then appoint a neutral/independent member of the NCI Executive (that has not been involved in the case) to review the investigation completed on behalf of the Registrar leading to the decision, as well as any additional information (oral or written) that was not considered by the Registrar. The outcome of this investigation would then be considered by an Appeals Panel comprised of the President and/or Vice President, SU President and the Executive member that conducted the investigation.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The NCI President cannot be involved in complaints at an earlier stage. They are the final point of appeal within the College and complaints addressed to them that have not gone through the appropriate channels outlined above will be referred to the Registrar.</p>\n<p>Appeal procedures:</p>\n<p>Learner must submit an Appeal Form on the Student Hub which will be send directly to the Office of the President. The Appeal Form must be submitted within 10 working days of receiving the written complaint response.</p>\n<p>Receipt of the appeals complaint form to be acknowledged within 48 hours ((excluding weekends/bank holidays where the learner would receive an acknowledgement the next working day after the weekend/bank holiday) along with next steps and that update will be communicated within 15 working days (inclusive of post the 48 hours acknowledgement). Learners will be kept updated throughout the appeals process and the 15 working days is to be used as an absolute maximum rather than the norm.</p>\n<p>The appeal will be investigated by a member of the NCI Executive appointed by the President or Vice President. Their role is to review and consider anything new at this phase.</p>\n<p>At all stages in this process, the President or their investgator could ask to meet with the complainant or any other individuals involved in the formal complaint investigation and they will at all times have the right to be supported by a colleague or an SU Sabbatical Officer (Not the SU President as they will need to be part of an Appeals Panel with the president/Vice-President).</p>\n<p>The group will be provided with a written report outlining the handling of the complaint, appeal documentation submitted by the Learner and gather additional evidence where applicable.</p>\n<p>Individual interviews may be conducted with the Learner and others involved where necessary.</p>\n<p>A learner may be accompanied by a Tutor, Student Support officer, member of SU, etc.</p>\n<p>Any staff member invited to a meeting with a complainant can be accompanied by a staff rep of their choice.</p>\n<p>A written report will be issued by the group. The report will be approved by the Registrar/Director of Student Registry and provided to the Learner within the 15 working days. Learner is given 10 working days to respond and if not fully satisfied, they can be referred to the Ombudsman.</p>\n<p><ul></p>\n<p><li>5.1.3.4 Monitoring and Feedback</li></p>\n<p></ul></p>\n<p>All formal complaints will be monitored by the Registrar, with annual reports provided to the President and presented to the Academic Council for consideration. Data and trends arising from formal and informal complaints and appeals will be gathered and analysed annually by the Office of the registrar to inform decision making at a programme, School and institutional level. An annual report will be produced to be considered by Academic Council. This monitoring process is part of the College’s efforts to continually improve its academic provisions, administrative processes and delivery of services to all cohorts of learners.</p>\n<p><ul></p>\n<p><li>5.1.3.5 Referral to Office of the Ombudsman</li></p>\n<p></ul></p>\n<p>If a learner has exhausted NCI’s internal complaint procedure and remains dissatisfied with the proposed recommendations, remedies offered or how the complaint itself was handled, they are entitled to refer their complaint to the Office of the Ombudsman (OO) in Ireland.</p>\n<p>The OO will seek to determine if there was any maladministration in the handling of the complaint and, if yes, the effects of this maladministration. While the OO handles complaints and determines appropriate redress first and foremost, its secondary role is to drive improvements in public administration and ensure institutional learning to prevent recurrence.</p>\n<p>If the OO decides to carry out an investigation, they must inform both the complainant and NCI of the results. NCI must also be afforded an opportunity to consider the matter and make representations before any adverse finding or criticism is made.</p>\n<p>The Ombudsman may investigate any action taken by or on behalf of NCI in the performance of administrative functions if that action has resulted in an adverse effect, intended or otherwise. These actions must have been either:</p>\n<p>taken without proper authority</p>\n<p>taken on irrelevant grounds</p>\n<p>the result of negligence or carelessness</p>\n<p>based on erroneous or incomplete information</p>\n<p>discriminatory</p>\n<p>based on an undesirable administrative practice</p>\n<p>a failure to comply with section 4A of the legislation or</p>\n<p>otherwise, contrary to fair and sound administration</p>\n<p>A complaint is excluded from the OO’s jurisdiction if a person has already initiated court proceedings or has a right of appeal to another body; the complaint was not made within 12 months of the action occurring; or the complaint relates to the terms and conditions of employment.</p>\n<p>Appendix 1</p>\n<p>Student Complaints Form</p>\n<p>To learn more about this topic, please read the following article: <a href=\"http://localhost:5001/articles/student-complaints-policy-national-college-of-ireland\" target=\"_blank\">Student Complaints Policy – National College of Ireland</a></p>\n<p><hr></p>\n<p>"}

This takes place once per annum and involves Programme Committees reviewing how programmes have performed in the previous academic year. The Committee is tasked with agreeing any changes – minor or major - to enhance the quality of modules within the programme. Such changes, if approved, will take effect the following academic year.</p>\n<p>B) Outside of the Annual Programme Monitoring Process: module lecturers can propose a minor change to a module outside of the APM process, if it is deemed necessary that the change takes effect from the next semester and this semester will begin before the APM process has completed.</p>\n<p>Deadline: The general rule is that a Minor Change Request must be approved by the Programme Director and received by the Quality Office (email: qie@ncirl.ie) no later than 4 weeks before the first day of teaching in the semester in which the module will be offered to learners.</p>\n<p>This deadline is set to provide adequate time for necessary adjustments to Module Descriptors, the Coursebuilder online curriculum repository and to Programme Handbooks/Course Materials for students and staff.</p>\n<p>In these cases, the Module Lecturer and Programme Director(s) are responsible for ensuring that the next iteration of the Annual Programme Report includes reference to the minor change that was approved and implemented.

This is the fundamental check to perform when considering whether a proposed change is minor: will this change impact on the stated module learning outcomes or on learners’ opportunity to achieve one or more of the learning outcomes? If in doubt, lecturers should seek advice from colleagues and from the Director of Quality; email qie@ncirl.ie</p>\n<p>Minor changes would typically comprise one of the following:</p>\n<p>The introduction of new topics into a module syllabus or the removal of outdated material or less important topics.</p>\n<p>A proposed syllabus/content change should not alter more than 20% of the total validated content at any one time since anything greater than this is likely to impact on the validated Module Learning Outcomes (MIMLOs).
